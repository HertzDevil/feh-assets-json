You don't want to\ntalk about it. I won't force you.$k$pI'm sorry. I don't mean to nag you\nso much. I'm sure it's gotten on your\nnerves by now.$k$pYou're probably craving some time\nto yourself. Let me get out of your\nway—I'll be just over there.$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|No! Please don't go!$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|Eir?$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|Forgive me. I wanted to tell you what\nwas bothering me, but it's difficult\nto put into words...$k$pWhen we sat in the shade earlier...\nI saw Hel. I don't know if she was\nan illusion, or...$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|You saw Hel?! But I didn't sense\nanything amiss... Perhaps it was\nonly in your mind?$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|Likely, yes. But the sight of her is not\nwhat bothered me. When I saw her...\nI instinctively called her \"Mother.\"$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|Ah...$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|After all that's happened... Even\nknowing it's only thanks to you and\nmy true mother that I'm alive...$k$pSomehow, when I see Hel, I still...$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|That's not your fault. In fact, it's\ncompletely understandable.$k$pYou were with Hel for so long—much\nlonger than you've been with any\nof the rest of us.$k$pIs this truly what's been bothering\nyou all day?$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|Of course it is. We have this rare\nopportunity to relax, and here I am\ndredging up the past... I'm sorry.$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|Eir, listen to me. You have absolutely\nnothing to apologize for.$k$pOn the contrary, I'm happy because\nyou were open and honest with me\nabout your feelings.$k$pThe way you clung to me and told me\nnot to go—just like when you were\nyoung. Butterflies in my stomach!$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|Ymir, I'm being serious...$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|Hee hee. Me too! It's important to\nask for help when you need it.\nI'm proud of you.$k$pI hope you'll keep on reaching out\nwhenever you need a little support.$k$pNot just to me, but to the summoner\nand everyone else as well.$k$pAnd I don't mean just in emergencies\nor when you have a problem! I mean\nwhen you're sad or hurting too, OK?$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|All right...$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|Thank you. I think it will do you a lot\nof good to share things like that\nwith people.$k$pSoon enough your doubts will be\nnothing more than a memory.$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|With you and all our friends to\nsupport me, I think you might\nbe right.$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|See? You're doing great!$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|Yes... It's all clear to me now...$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|Hm? What is it?$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|Nothing important. Shall we go for\nanother dip in the water?$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|Ooo, yes! Race you!$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|It wasn't Hel...it was my own mind.\nA manifestation of my insecurity,\ntelling me to beware...$k$pWarning me that I should not enjoy\nthe happiness of this beach, or Ymir's\ncompany...for fear of losing it.$k$pBut I've come to understand that,\nif I don't face that fear, I'll never\nbe happy in the first place.$k$pThanks to Ymir, and all my friends,\nI finally have the strength to do that.$k$pThank you, everyone. This is a trip\nI will never forget...$k$p$Sbs150|"
