They're preoccupied\nwith Gullinbursti upkeep for the\ntime being.$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Excellent. Let's get on with the\ntest, then.$k$p$WmMEID_オッテル,ch00_31_Otr_M_Normal,Face|Does this attempt seem any more\nlikely to succeed? I'd rather not have\nto clean up corpses again.$k$pThis experiment of yours, trying\nto recreate Askr's divine weapon,\nBreidablik...$k$pThough you've demonstrated your\nability to bring Heroes here from\nother worlds...$k$pThus far, they have all lost their\nminds and been reduced to ruin.$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face|That or their memory is wiped\nclean and they wander the land,\nfailing to fulfill their purpose, yes.$k$p$WmMEID_オッテル,ch00_31_Otr_M_Normal,Face_Pain|Are you referring...to Fáfnir?$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face|Never mind. You can trust I have\nmade adjustments that should\nincrease our chances of success.$k$pHeroes from other worlds are not\nalways of stable body and mind.\nThere are so many worlds, you see.$k$pThe occurrence or non-occurrence of\nspecific events can drastically alter\ntheir personalities.$k$p$WmMEID_オッテル,ch00_31_Otr_M_Normal,Face|What are you getting at?$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face_Smile2|If our problem is that Heroes we\nsummon lose their minds and\ntheir usefulness...$k$pI thought, why not summon Heroes\nwho have already lost their minds?\nPerhaps they'll remain useful!$k$p$WmMEID_オッテル,ch00_31_Otr_M_Normal,Face|And does your solution keep them\nfrom losing their memories as well?$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face_Smile|In theory. They'll keep the important\nmemories, at any rate—like how to\nbest crush our enemies.$k$p$WmMEID_オッテル,ch00_31_Otr_M_Normal,Face|That's all well and good, but how\nwill we control them if they have\nindeed lost their minds?$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face_Cool|We can't know until we try.
