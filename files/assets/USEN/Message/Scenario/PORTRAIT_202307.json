I'm proud of you all. You're\nfighting like true Brodians!$k$p$WmMPID_魔器スタルーク,ch19_14_Staluke_M_Weapon01,Face|Not me. I've been totally unhelpful.\nIf anything, I'd say I'm holding us\nback.$k$pMaybe I should be a decoy—get them\nto aim their attacks at me. Then at\nleast you three can survive.$k$p$WmMPID_ラピス,ch19_15_Lapis_F_Normal,Face|Don't talk like that, Prince Alcryst!\nIf anyone's going to distract them,\nit ought to be me and Citrinne.$k$p$WmMPID_シトリニカ,ch19_16_Citrinica_F_Normal,Face|I agree.

Enemies behind us.\nNot many, but they look formidable.$k$p$WmMPID_ディアマンド,ch19_11_Diamand_M_Normal,Face|Good spotting, Alcryst. Now, prepare\nfor battle!$k$p$WmMPID_ラピス,ch19_15_Lapis_F_Normal,Face|Let's lay them low!$k$p$WmMPID_シトリニカ,ch19_16_Citrinica_F_Normal,Face|With any luck, we'll be back at the\ncastle by dinnertime.$k$p"
