I never\nimagined something like this could\nhappen within the castle's walls!$k$p$WmMPID_ニシキ,ch05_49_Nishiki_M_Normal,Face|Whoa! What's with the face, Alfonse?\nYou too, $Nu!$k$p$WmMPID_キヌ,ch05_47_Kinu_F_Normal,Face|Looks like you're hard at work\nthinking! Trying to come up with\na new game to play?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Unfortunately, no. Are you familiar\nwith the Orbs we use to summon\nHeroes? Well, they're missing.$k$p$WmMPID_ニシキ,ch05_49_Nishiki_M_Normal,Face|So the Orbs just disappeared out\nof $Nu's room?$k$p$WmMPID_キヌ,ch05_47_Kinu_F_Normal,Face|Hmm... Hey! Orbs are those round\nsparkly thingies, aren't they?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Right. And without them, we can't\nsummon Heroes here from worlds\nbeyond this one...$k$pThat means the Order of Heroes\ncan't gain new recruits, which will\nreduce our effectiveness in battle.$k$p$WmMPID_ニシキ,ch05_49_Nishiki_M_Normal,Face|I see. If something that important just\ndisappeared, I understand why you'd\nbe worried!$k$p$WmMPID_キヌ,ch05_47_Kinu_F_Normal,Face|Wait—I know where they are!$k$p$WmMPID_ニシキ,ch05_49_Nishiki_M_Normal,Face|Well, Selkie? Don't just stand there\nwagging your tail! Spit it out already!$k$p$WmMPID_キヌ,ch05_47_Kinu_F_Normal,Face|Well, you see... Not long ago, I was\nrunning around the castle, and I ran\npast $Nu's room...$k$pI didn't think anything of it at the\ntime, but I did see Keaton and\nVelouria lurking around...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|What? Really?! Lurking? Were they\nplanning something?$k$p$WmMPID_キヌ,ch05_47_Kinu_F_Normal,Face|Well, I saw them separately, so...\nmaybe? I was doing laps around the\ncastle, so I passed a few times...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|Could...they have taken the Orbs?$k$p$WmMPID_ニシキ,ch05_49_Nishiki_M_Normal,Face|If you really want to know, it'd\nprobably be easiest to just ask them!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|Hm... You're right. In any case, I want\nmore information. It's possible they\nsaw something!$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_フランネル,ch05_50_Flannel_M_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|Huh? Why would I ever need to go\nin $Nu's room?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|Er, well... You were seen near the\nroom, so I wanted to ask if you saw\nanything...unusual.$k$p$WmMPID_フランネル,ch05_50_Flannel_M_Normal,Face|Nope! Nothing unusual! Anyway, I'm\nabout to go hunting... Do you mind?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Oh... Right! Go ahead. Sorry for\nkeeping you.$k$p$EFace_Anger|Hm. If Keaton says he didn't go near\n$Nu's room...$k$pVelouria might still know something.\nWe'll see what she has to say!$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_ベロア,ch05_48_Velour_F_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|There's nothing interesting over\nthere, so I have no reason to go\nby $Nu's room...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|Er, well... You were seen over by\nthe room, so I wanted to ask if you\nmaybe saw anything...unusual?$k$p$WmMPID_ベロア,ch05_48_Velour_F_Normal,Face|Whoever thinks they saw me was\nmistaken. Now, if you don't need\nanything else, I'll be going...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|Huh. So Velouria claims to not know\nanything about the Orb theft either...$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_ニシキ,ch05_49_Nishiki_M_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|I see... So neither Keaton nor Velouria\nadmitted to being where Selkie says\nshe saw them?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Right. And nothing either of them\nsaid struck me as suspicious.$k$p$WmMPID_キヌ,ch05_47_Kinu_F_Normal,Face|I swear I saw them! But I also doubt\neither could be the Orb thief we're\nlooking for.$k$p$WmMPID_ニシキ,ch05_49_Nishiki_M_Normal,Face|Yeah, they're both a little odd, but...\nthey're not bad people. Which means\nthere's still a mystery to solve!$k$pIt's up to me—Kaden, the greatest\nand most beautiful detective—to\ncatch this Orb thief of ours!$k$p$WmMPID_キヌ,ch05_47_Kinu_F_Normal,Face|I wanna play too! I'll be your trusty\nassistant, Selkie! We'll get those Orbs\nback in no time!$k$p"
