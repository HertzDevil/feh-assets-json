Took you long enou—$k$p$WmMPID_シェズ男,ch17_67_Sheds_M_Normal,Face|Hey there, Hilda.$k$p$WmMPID_開花ヒルダ,ch17_25_Hilda_F_Bloom01,Face|Excuse me? What are YOU doing\nhere?$k$p$WmMPID_シェズ男,ch17_67_Sheds_M_Normal,Face|Florina had a request, and since she's\nstill not great at dealing with men, the\nother Shez and I decided to swap jobs.$k$p$WmMPID_開花ヒルダ,ch17_25_Hilda_F_Bloom01,Face|You two are still taking on jobs as a\npair? Kind of weird, if you ask me.$k$p$WmMPID_シェズ男,ch17_67_Sheds_M_Normal,Face|Is it? Gender aside, we are still pretty\nmuch the same person. So why not\ntake advantage of that?$k$p$WmMPID_開花ヒルダ,ch17_25_Hilda_F_Bloom01,Face|Huh... I mean, I guess you have a\npoint. It still seems a little weird,\nthough.$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_モニカ,ch17_53_Monica_F_Normal2,Face|$Fi1500|May I have a moment?

Well, not like it matters much.\nI'm sure either of us is fine, so I'll\nhear you out.$k$p$WmMPID_モニカ,ch17_53_Monica_F_Normal2,Face|Oh, well, I meant to ask the other\nShez, but if you say it's all right,\nI would be happy for the help.$k$pThat being said, isn't this his room?$k$p$WmMPID_シェズ女,ch17_68_Sheds_F_Normal,Face|Yeah, but it's no big deal—we're not\nusually in the castle at the same time.\nAnyway, I can handle anything he can.$k$pAt the end of the day, we both follow\nthe merc creed of using whatever\nwe can as a resource.$k$p$WmMPID_モニカ,ch17_53_Monica_F_Normal2,Face|You're both mercenaries through and\nthrough, aren't you? I doubt I could\nwork with another me so easily.$k$pAnd yet, the two of you have simply\naccepted it and, what's more, even\nmade use of it. I'm truly impressed.$k$p"
