But where am I\ngoing to find an easy meal?$k$p$WmMPID_幼少ワユ,ch09_09_Wayu_F_Before01,Face|Hey, Ilyana! Just the gal I was looking\nfor.$k$p$WmMPID_幼少イレース,ch09_14_Erase_F_Before01,Face|You're...Mia, right? Why were you\nlooking for me? Are you bringing me\na snack?$k$p$WmMPID_幼少ワユ,ch09_09_Wayu_F_Before01,Face|Huh? No! There you go again, always\nthinking with your stomach.$k$pLook, I was training in the forest\nwhen somebody from a nearby\nvillage called out for help.$k$pSome nasty bandits took off with the\nlocal food supply, and they need help\ngetting it back.$k$pSo I'm looking for like-minded\nwarriors to help me do just that. Can\nI count on you?$k$p$WmMPID_幼少イレース,ch09_14_Erase_F_Before01,Face|They stole the village's food? Oh no,\nthat's so horrible...$k$p$WmMPID_幼少ワユ,ch09_09_Wayu_F_Before01,Face|I know, right? I said I would help out,\nbut they laughed and said I was just,\nwell, just a kid.$k$pLittle do they know we're training\nwith members of the Order of\nHeroes!$k$pThis is our chance to show everyone\nwhat we're made of. What do you\nthink?$k$p$WmMPID_幼少イレース,ch09_14_Erase_F_Before01,Face|It would be my pleasure...$k$pAll that food...enough to feed an\nentire village... That would be wasted\non bandits.$k$pThose good people are counting on\nevery single grain. We have to get\nit all back. They'll be so grateful...$k$p$WmMPID_幼少ワユ,ch09_09_Wayu_F_Before01,Face|Just to be clear, we're not doing this\nfor a rewa—oh, never mind.\nLet's go!$k$pNow that you've got my back, I'm\nmore pumped than ever!$k$p$WmMPID_幼少イレース,ch09_14_Erase_F_Before01,Face|Mm-hm...

We\nmanaged to recover all of the food\nand capture the bandits to boot!$k$pAfter great teamwork like that,\nnobody's gonna underestimate us\nagain. Right, Ilyana?$k$p$WmMPID_幼少イレース,ch09_14_Erase_F_Before01,Face|Let's see... Loaves of bread, bushels\nof wheat... Racks of meat, barrels of\nfish...

It's...it's almost\noverwhelming...$k$p$WmMPID_幼少ワユ,ch09_09_Wayu_F_Before01,Face|Er, right... I'm sure everyone in the\nvillage worked their tails off to hunt\nand harvest it all.$k$pThey wouldn't last through the winter\nwithout it.
