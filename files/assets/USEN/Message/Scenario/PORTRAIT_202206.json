    "value": "$WmMPID_ケント,ch03_35_Kent_M_Normal,Face|Hmm... You would request our aid\nin drawing up a revised map of Askr?$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|That's right. There's a remote region\nin the southwest that we're lacking\nrecent intelligence on.$k$pOn the surface, it may not seem like\nthe kind of flashy work we usually\nask you Heroes to do, but...$k$pWell, I suspect that you'll find no end\nof unsavory elements lurking among\nthe trees and rocks.$k$p$WmMPID_ギィ,ch03_36_Guy_M_Normal,Face|Gotcha. So we're really there to\nstamp out the bandits...while also\nupdating the map, of course.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|Exactly! Oh, and just a heads-up: this\nis the most recent one we have...from\nfifty years ago.$k$pThere's been an earthquake since\nthen, so be careful.$k$p$WmMPID_セイン,ch03_34_Sein_M_Normal,Face|Five decades is a lot of time for the\nlandscape to change. This map may\nnot be of much use.$k$p$WmMPID_ケント,ch03_35_Kent_M_Normal,Face|Perhaps not. But that is all the more\nreason for us to accept this mission\nto update it.$k$pBoth the merchants and military of\nAskr will surely be served by access\nto more modern maps.$k$p$WmMPID_セイン,ch03_34_Sein_M_Normal,Face|Most men would scoff at the mere\nthought of being made to do such\nmenial labor, but not I!$k$pYou see, ladies? The gallant Sain will\nnever shirk his duty to you or the\nOrder of Heroes!$k$p$WmMPID_ギィ,ch03_36_Guy_M_Normal,Face|I'm in. I can't be the most skilled\nswordsman in Sacae if I let some\nbandits get the best of me, right?$k$pI've been itching for a battlefield to\ntest my blade, and this looks like my\nchance. Leave it to me, Commander!$k$p$WmMPID_開花フロリーナ,ch03_08_Flolina_F_Bloom01,Face|Um... I'll join too... If that's all right.$k$pI've got a bird's-eye view from my\npegasus, so I can make sure the map\nlooks accurate from above.$k$p$WmMPID_ケント,ch03_35_Kent_M_Normal,Face|Such a high vantage point will prove\ninvaluable in our map-making efforts.\nThank you.$k$p$WmMPID_開花フロリーナ,ch03_08_Flolina_F_Bloom01,Face|Oh! Um... You're welcome...$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face|I'm coming too! You've got the sky\ncovered, but what about the ground?$k$pMy Gullinbursti can traverse rocky\nterrain like it's nothing. Just point me\nwhere to go, and I'll be there!$k$p$WmMPID_セイン,ch03_34_Sein_M_Normal,Face|The more ladies, the merrier!\nWelcome aboard, Princess Reginn!$k$p$WmMPID_ケント,ch03_35_Kent_M_Normal,Face|Sain, need I remind you that we are\nembarking on a mission, not a picnic?$k$pThis will be our first official duty after\nbeing summoned to Askr. We must\nnot take it lightly.$k$pPrincess Reginn, if Sain happens to\nbother you, simply say the word and\nI will deal with him myself.$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face|Oh, uh... If you say so. But I'd really\nprefer it if we all just got along!$k$p$WmMPID_セイン,ch03_34_Sein_M_Normal,Face|Alas, it seems that the ladies of Askr\nhave about as much trust in me as\nthose of Elibe...$k$p$WmMPID_ギィ,ch03_36_Guy_M_Normal,Face|It may not be a picnic, but we should\nstill prepare plenty of provisions in\ncase we're gone for a while.$k$p$WmMPID_開花フロリーナ,ch03_08_Flolina_F_Bloom01,Face|Good idea. I, um... I'll try not to slow\nus down too much.$k$p"
