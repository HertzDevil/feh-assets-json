And maybe Ótr knows\nthe truth...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Right. He probably found the\ntreasure as well, and threw it\ninto the thicket himself.$k$p$WmMEID_ダグ,ch00_34_Dagr_F_Normal,Face_Pain|That's all great, but...the only thing\nthis tells us is that he isn't from\nNiðavellir, right?$k$p$WmMEID_ノート,ch00_33_Nott_F_Normal,Face|We've gained insight into our foe.\nIt is a step in the right direction.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Normal2|What step comes next then?
