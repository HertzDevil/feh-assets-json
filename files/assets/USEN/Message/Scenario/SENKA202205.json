Not sure\nwhat the blue was about, though...$k$pThere's no question who Lord Roy is\ngoing to choose to accompany him\ndown the aisle: me!$k$pNow that that's taken care of, I am\na bit hungry. Hmm... Can't have my\nstomach rumbling at the altar...$k$pMaybe I should take a bite of this last\nStamina Lunch that I tucked away for\nlater. Good thinking, Larum!$k$pOh, right! I almost forgot I prepared\nthis one especially for Father. I'm\nsure he'd love it, but...$k$pWhere IS he? And is he going to make\nit in time for the ceremony?$k$pI'm sure he'd be thrilled to see his\ndarling daughter beaming on her\nbig day!$k$pI've always dreamed of the day that\nhe'd escort me down the aisle, and\nnow it's practically here!$k$pI'm going to show everyone how far\nI've come and how much I've grown\nsince he adopted me!$k$pWait... Now that I think about it,\ngetting married means we can't live\ntogether anymore, huh...$k$pOh no, he'll be so lonely! Maybe this\nwhole ceremony thing can wait just a\nbit longer after all.$k$pI'm sure Lord Roy won't mind. True\nlove lasts forever, right?$k$pHow about we just call this a dress\nrehearsal, then? Don't worry, Father!\nPractice makes perfect!$k$p"
