    "value": "$WmMPID_イドゥン,ch02_14_Idenn_F_Normal,Face|In my world, I was kept in a place of\nendless darkness. A void of shadow.$k$pIn the darkness, I dreamt an empty\ndream...for a long time.$k$pI, too, am empty now, so I am not\ntroubled by appetites and desires.$k$pMy reason to be is the destruction of\nhumanity—to free my world...$k$pBut...this is not my world. I wonder...\nDoes this world require the same\nfreedom? It's...confusing.$k$pAll that is certain is that I...must not\nstay here, at this castle.$k$pConfusion and power do not...\ncombine well.$k$p$WmMPID_ルゥ,ch02_15_Lugh_M_Normal,Face|Huh. Yeah, I understand why you'd\nwant to leave the castle now.$k$pBut...do you have anywhere to go?\nYou were just summoned, so it's all\nnew territory here, right?$k$p$WmMPID_イドゥン,ch02_14_Idenn_F_Normal,Face|Yes... I have no place to go. And I\nknow nothing of this world.$k$pBut as a Demon Dragon, I do know\nI cannot stay here...$k$p$WmMPID_ルゥ,ch02_15_Lugh_M_Normal,Face|Hmm... Seems like you're dead set on\nleaving then. If that's the case, I'll tag\nalong!$k$pIf we can sort out your reason for\nbeing here now, you'll come back\nto the castle again, won't you?$k$p$WmMPID_イドゥン,ch02_14_Idenn_F_Normal,Face|...$k$p$WmMPID_ルゥ,ch02_15_Lugh_M_Normal,Face|H-hey! Wait up!$k$p...How are you so fast!$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|$Fi1500|Any sign over there, Sharena?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Nothing yet!$k$pWhere could Idunn have gone? And\nwhy? Was something troubling her?$k$p$WmMPID_ティト,ch02_17_Thite_F_Normal,Face|Hey, what are you two up to?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Oh, hi, Thea! Actually, we were\nlooking for Idunn... Have you seen\nher?$k$p$WmMPID_ティト,ch02_17_Thite_F_Normal,Face|Idunn? The...Dark Priestess? She left\nthe castle, did she?$k$p$WmMPID_スー,ch02_16_Sue_F_Normal,Face|Apologies. I overheard you asking\nabout Idunn... I saw her speaking with\nLugh at the castle gate this morning.$k$pI was in the western spire at the time,\nhowever, so I was unable to hear\nwhat they were talking about...$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Wait—you were able to see them all\nthe way from there?! They must have\nlooked like specks of dust!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|Now that you mention it, I haven't\nseen Lugh around either... Perhaps\nthe two of them left together.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Yeah! They could have just gone to\ntown to do a little shopping together!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|I—uhh... That seems unlikely.$k$p$WmMPID_ティト,ch02_17_Thite_F_Normal,Face|Whatever the case...we cannot just\nstand by, can we? Lugh would have\ntold someone where he was going...$k$p$WmMPID_スー,ch02_16_Sue_F_Normal,Face|Right. We should search for them.\nPlease, allow me to assist.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Thanks. Your help means a lot. Both\nof you.$k$p$WmMPID_ティト,ch02_17_Thite_F_Normal,Face|Are you comfortable riding a pegasus,\nPrincess Sharena? We could look for\nthem from the sky.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Nice plan, Thea. I'll be the navigator!\nDon't worry—I give perfect directions.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Great. Then Sue and I will try to\nfollow their trail on the ground.$k$p$WmMPID_スー,ch02_16_Sue_F_Normal,Face|The sooner we leave, the sooner we\ncan find them. Let's go.$k$p"
