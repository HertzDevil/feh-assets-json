The emperor...$k$p$WmMPID_ザカリア影,ch90_02_FighterAX_M_Normal,Face|Put your mind at ease. The emperor\nis no friend to Veronica. After all, the\ntwo share no blood between them.$k$pWhen Veronica faces accusation,\nshe will become a political liability\nand a threat the emperor's control...$k$pWith Veronica more popular with the\npeople, the emperor will likely not\nshy away from removing that threat.$k$pWe can use the opportunity to have\nVeronica put into exile... Perhaps\neven execution will be an option.$k$p$WmMPID_ザカリア影,ch90_02_FighterAX_M_Normal,Face|Excellent. Then...allow me to propose\na toast then. To our success!$k$p...And Veronica's demise.$k$p$Sbs150|"
