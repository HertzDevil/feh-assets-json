Investigations? What do you\nwant investigated?$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|Well, there's a tournament coming\nup related to the ninja festival.$k$pThe strongest entrants appear to be\nNavarre, Zihark, and then Lyn and\nFlorina—who've entered as a team.$k$pIf we can learn anything about them\nbefore the fighting starts, we might\nbe able to get an advantage!$k$p$WmMPID_忍者レーヴァテイン,ch00_09_Laevatain_F_Ninja20,Face|I see. My sister would agree that\nknowing your enemy is important.$k$pI will go along with it.$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|All right! Then let's get investigating!\nActually, wait... Hmmm... We might\nhave a bit of a problem.$k$pLyn and Florina are always together,\nand Navarre is terrifying... Maybe we\nshould focus on Zihark?$k$p$WmMPID_忍者レーヴァテイン,ch00_09_Laevatain_F_Ninja20,Face|I've heard a little about Zihark.\nHe sounds like a good place\nto start investigating.$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|Then it's decided! Let's prowl\nthrough the shadows like the\nninja we are. Sneaky, stealthy...$k$p$WmMPID_忍者レーヴァテイン,ch00_09_Laevatain_F_Ninja20,Face|Sneaky. Stealthy.$k$p"

Oh, I'm sorry, Zihark!\nWe were were just investigating you,\nand we—$k$p$WmMPID_忍者ツイハーク,ch09_22_Twihark_M_Ninja20,Face|Me? Why investigate me?$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|Well, since we're dressed as ninja,\nwe wanted to do something that felt\nproperly ninja-like...$k$pAnd we thought maybe we could get\nan advantage in the tournament too...$k$p$WmMPID_忍者レーヴァテイン,ch00_09_Laevatain_F_Ninja20,Face|But we discovered more than\nwe intended... About your past.\nAbout your former love...$k$p$WmMPID_忍者ツイハーク,ch09_22_Twihark_M_Ninja20,Face|Ah. Well, there are some around\nhere who already know all about\nthat, I suppose.$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|We're sorry for digging into your\npast, Zihark!

But I'd\nrecommend not investigating into\nme any further, all right?$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|Of course. Again, we apologize.\nWe brought painful memories\nto the surface, I'm sure...$k$p$WmMPID_忍者ツイハーク,ch09_22_Twihark_M_Ninja20,Face|No need to worry. It's not as if I want\nto forget her.

But still! A festival is no place\nto be so gloomy. We should enjoy it!$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|You're right. Thank you, Zihark.\nI'll see you at the tournament!\nI'm bringing everything I've got.$k$p$WmMPID_忍者ツイハーク,ch09_22_Twihark_M_Ninja20,Face|Then I'll be sure to do the same.\nI'll look forward to it! For now, I'll\nbe on my way, though. See you!$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|Phew! We're lucky Zihark is such\na kind person.$k$p$WmMPID_忍者レーヴァテイン,ch00_09_Laevatain_F_Ninja20,Face|He reminds me of my sister...\nKind, understanding of others'\npain, and incredibly strong...$k$p$WmMPID_忍者カザハナ,ch05_02_Kazahana_F_Ninja20,Face|That's true. It's a particular kind\nof strength I'd like to aspire to...$k$pWe both use swords, after all!\nThough, I don't get the same\nkind of respect he gets.$k$pWell, I guess I'll just have to beat him\nin the tournament!
