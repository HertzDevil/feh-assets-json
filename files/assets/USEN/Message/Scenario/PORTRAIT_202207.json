What is it?$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|I ask this of every new Alm and Celica\nwho finds their way to Askr, so don't\ntake it personally, but...$k$p$EFace_Pain|If you happen to come upon wooden\nboxes or urns out in the field, um...\nBe sure not to break them, OK?$k$p$WmMPID_開花セリカ,ch10_08_Cellica_F_Bloom01,Face|Oh, uh... Certainly. I will keep that\nin mind.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|Great! For some reason, you're the\nonly ones from Valentia who even\nnotice the crates around Askr.$k$pBut every time you do, you and Alm\nget this crazy look in your eyes and\njust smash them to pieces!$k$p$WmMPID_開花セリカ,ch10_08_Cellica_F_Bloom01,Face|Yes, well... It's almost like there's\nan unseen force guiding our hand...$k$p$WmMPID_アトラス,ch10_36_Atlus_M_Normal,Face|Hmm...$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_アトラス,ch10_36_Atlus_M_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|Kamui, have you seen the priestess?$k$p$WmMPID_外伝カムイ,ch10_35_Kamui_M_Normal,Face|Oh, she said something about taking\na stroll around the castle grounds\nto clear her head.$k$p$WmMPID_アトラス,ch10_36_Atlus_M_Normal,Face|That so...$k$p$WmMPID_外伝エスト,ch10_34_Est_F_Normal,Face|Hey... Did everyone else know that\nthe priestess is actually a princess?\nOf Zofia, right?$k$p$WmMPID_外伝カムイ,ch10_35_Kamui_M_Normal,Face|I knew she was far from ordinary, at\nthe very least. She's probably just got\na lot of things on her mind.$k$pI told her that fighting necrodragons\nmakes me weak in the knees, but\nit's like she clean forgot...$k$p$WmMPID_外伝エスト,ch10_34_Est_F_Normal,Face|Did you ever suspect that she was\nroyalty, though? I mean, she does\nhave a certain grace...$k$p$WmMPID_アトラス,ch10_36_Atlus_M_Normal,Face|If it wasn't for her kindness and\nbravery, my brothers would still be\nat the mercy of bandits.$k$pThat she was a princess all along\ncame as no surprise to me.

She just seemed\ndistracted, I guess. Like her mind\nwas someplace else.$k$p$WmMPID_アトラス,ch10_36_Atlus_M_Normal,Face|You might be onto something...$k$p"
