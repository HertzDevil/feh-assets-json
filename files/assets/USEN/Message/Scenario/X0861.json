That is true.$k$pJust as the rodents underground\nwould not be able to live if the sun\nshone in their burrows.$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|Whether in the forest or the sea,\nmost creatures can only thrive in\ntheir natural habitats.$k$pI have learned a great deal from\nobserving the outdoors...$k$pMore than I ever could have hoped\nto learn by staying holed up inside.$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|I suppose we owe our thanks to\n$Nu, don't we?$k$pI'm so grateful that the summoner's\ninvitation has allowed me to see you\nexperience all of these new things.$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|Indeed.

Are you all right?!$k$p$nMPID_神階エイル|An illusion?$k$pSorry to worry you. I'm fine. I just got\na little disoriented for a moment as\nwe stepped into the shade...$k$p$nMPID_比翼ユーミル|Oh!
