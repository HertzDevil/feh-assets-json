How about this weather?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Is it me, or has it gotten really tense\nhere all of a sudden?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_ELECTION01,Face|Really? I hadn't noticed. What could\npossibly have these two so worked\nup, I wonder?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙リシテア,ch17_23_Lysithea_F_ELECTION01,Face|You can drop the act, Claude.\nThis isn't Fódlan.$k$pAre we really going to insist on\ndragging Fódlan's conflict into Askr?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙エーデル,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_ELECTION01,Face|No. Lysithea has a point. There is no\ngood reason for us to fight one\nanother in this world.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙ディミトリ,ch17_03_Dimitri_M_ELECTION01,Face|I suppose the change does render\nour old grudges rather irrelevant.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_ELECTION01,Face|Spoken just like the Dimitri I... Nope,\ncan't get through it with a straight\nface. When did you learn to relax?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙エーデル,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_ELECTION01,Face|I must admit, I share his surprise.\nYou are a completely different person\nthan the Dimitri I faced in battle.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙ディミトリ,ch17_03_Dimitri_M_ELECTION01,Face|I shudder to think what became\nof me in your worlds.$k$pIn my Fódlan, the Kingdom of\nFaerghus defeated the Adrestian\nEmpire, and I was crowned king.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_ELECTION01,Face|Yeah, that's...not what happened\nin mine.$k$pAnd I'll bet the Empire was victorious\nin your Fódlan, wasn't it, Princess?\nOr should I say Your Majesty?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙エーデル,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_ELECTION01,Face|Yes, it was. But victory did not come\nby my strength alone. My teacher\nwas always at my side.$k$pThe war in your world must have\ngone well for the Leicester Alliance,\nClaude. Did you become king?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙リシテア,ch17_23_Lysithea_F_ELECTION01,Face|The Alliance did win the war, and we\ndid establish a new unified kingdom\nof Fódlan.$k$pClaude didn't rule it, though. He went\nback home to Almyra and lived as\nroyalty there.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙ディミトリ,ch17_03_Dimitri_M_ELECTION01,Face|Claude is Almyran royalty?$k$pHow can that be? Were you not\nthe heir to House Riegan?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_ELECTION01,Face|We can talk out little details like that\nanother time. For now, I have a favor\nto ask of the both of you.$k$pFirst, why don't we stop giving\nPrincess Sharena a headache and\ncall a truce for our stay in Askr?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Yes, please! I'm all for that. We can't\nhave the Heroes fighting each other.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙ディミトリ,ch17_03_Dimitri_M_ELECTION01,Face|I understand that our purpose here is\nto defend the people of Askr.\nWith that in mind...I accept.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙エーデル,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_ELECTION01,Face|As do I. To be at one another's\nthroats now would be counter\nto all our goals.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_ELECTION01,Face|Great to hear. There's just one more\ntiny little wrinkle.$k$pThere are other versions of us here.\nVersions who are five years younger.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙エーデル,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_ELECTION01,Face|You're joking.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_ELECTION01,Face|Afraid I'm not. So let's all keep clear\nof them, OK? It's for the best we not\ntalk to them about...well, anything.$k$p"
