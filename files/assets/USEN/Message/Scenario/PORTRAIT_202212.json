All of your fathers are\nhere, working for the Order of\nHeroes to help Askr!$k$pObviously they're all powerful assets\non the battlefield, but they help out\nwith festivals and stuff like that too.$k$p$WmMPID_マトイ,ch05_61_Matoi_F_Normal,Face|Yes, my father has told me as much.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|So upright! So dignified! You're the\nspitting image of Subaki, Caeldori.$k$p$WmMPID_マトイ,ch05_61_Matoi_F_Normal,Face|Ah... Thank you, but the truth is I am\nnowhere near his equal. Not yet.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Aw, that's not true. Hey, Kiragi! Show\nme how you draw that bow! I bet\nyou'll look just like Takumi!$k$p$WmMPID_キサラギ,ch05_62_Kisaragi_M_Normal,Face|You think so, Princess Sharena?\nWell... Good! I'm glad!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Oh, and Dwyer, that coffee you made\nme this morning was phenomenal!\nDid Jakob teach you how to brew?$k$p$WmMPID_ディーア,ch05_60_Deere_M_Normal,Face|He trained me to be a butler. But\nwhen it comes to coffee...it is he\nwho aspires to match my skill.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Oh, wow! I'll keep that in mind.\nSay, Ophelia, could you tell me\nabout that tome you've got?$k$pIf your father were here, I'm sure he\nwould say something like \"I sense\na terrrrible power lurking within!\"$k$p$WmMPID_魔器オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Weapon01,Face|...$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Um, Ophelia? I didn't offend you,\ndid I? Sorry, I know I get carried\naway sometimes.$k$p$WmMPID_魔器オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Weapon01,Face|At last, these esoteric visions have\nbegun to make sense to me. Yes,\nI understand them all too well now.$k$pThis hand, imbued with incredible\npower. This tome, placed into that\nhand as if by the will of destiny.$k$pThis land of Askr, plagued by endless\nwar! Yes, I see now why I descended\nupon this place!$k$p$WmMPID_キサラギ,ch05_62_Kisaragi_M_Normal,Face|Uh... What's going on with Ophelia?\nDo you know, Caeldori?$k$p$WmMPID_マトイ,ch05_61_Matoi_F_Normal,Face|I haven't the faintest idea. Nothing\nshe's saying makes any sense to me.$k$p$WmMPID_ディーア,ch05_60_Deere_M_Normal,Face|Maybe she hit her head on the\nsummoning gate.$k$p$WmMPID_魔器オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Weapon01,Face|Your words have made everything\nclear to me, Princess Sharena.$k$pThis Order of Heroes, with its flattery\nand its festivals, is ill-prepared to\nprotect this doomed world!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Umm, what? What do you mean\nby that?$k$p$WmMPID_魔器オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Weapon01,Face|I mean precisely what I say! Open\nyour ears as you do your gates!$k$pBeach vacations? Holiday festivals?\nDestruction is on your doorstep!\nHow do you justify such frivolity?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Hey, we get up to a bit of fun here,\nbut you've got the wrong idea.$k$p$EFace_Anger|Every Hero is giving the mission to\nsave Askr their all!$k$p$WmMPID_魔器オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Weapon01,Face|Your words are empty air.$k$pThe jaws of annihilation are clenched\naround you. They are without mercy.\nThey wait for no one!$k$p$WmMPID_キサラギ,ch05_62_Kisaragi_M_Normal,Face|Right... Isn't that why we're here?\nTo help with that?$k$p$WmMPID_魔器オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Weapon01,Face|Indeed, we have been called to this\nplace for that very reason.$k$pBut this Order of Heroes is merely a\ncrumbling farce. They lack the power\nto fulfill their ambitions!$k$p$WmMPID_マトイ,ch05_61_Matoi_F_Normal,Face|Are you OK, Ophelia?$k$p$WmMPID_魔器オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Weapon01,Face|No longer will I answer to the name\nOphelia Dusk. You will now address\nme as Ophelia the Resurgent Star!$k$pI hereby declare that the Order of\nHeroes shall meet its end! I alone\nwill usher Askr to its salvation!$k$p"
