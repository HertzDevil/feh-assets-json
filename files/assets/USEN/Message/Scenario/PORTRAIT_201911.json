    "value": "$WmMPID_比翼エフラム,ch08_00_Ephraim_MM_Pair,Face|I've been thinking, Lyon.$k$pWe were summoned here to fight for\nAskr's peace, but at the same time,\nI wonder...am I being tested?$k$p$nMPID_リオン|As unlike you as this manner of\nintrospection is, Ephraim...it pleases\nme to see.$k$p$nMPID_比翼エフラム|That is why I've decided to serve\nAskr not as the prince of Renais,\nbut rather as a humble mercenary.$k$p$nMPID_リオン|I thought you might have something\nlike that in mind.$k$pYou want to test your potential as a\nsoldier, without politics getting\nin the way.$k$pBut are you not concerned about\nneglecting your royal duties?$k$p$nMPID_比翼エフラム|When I carve out my future, it will be\nwith my lance. Not with my title.$k$pI hope that, when history remembers\nme, my noble birth will be only a\nfootnote to my strength.$k$pAskr presents the perfect opportunity\nfor me to become the strongest\nfighter in all Magvel.$k$pI dare say I feel as if I have been\nsummoned here for that very reason.$k$p$nMPID_リオン|Be mindful to whom you say such\nthings, Ephraim. These words could\ninvite misunderstanding...$k$p$WmMPID_ジスト,ch08_14_Xyst_M_Normal,Face|Strongest fighter in Magvel, you say?\nAnd as a mercenary, no less? I had\nno idea you were so ambitious.$k$pSorry. Couldn't help but overhear.$k$p$WmMPID_リオン,ch08_00_Ephraim_MM_Pair,Face|Commander Gerik! Might I suggest\nyou keep what you have heard in\nthe strictest confidence?$k$p$nMPID_比翼エフラム|Why should he have to do that?\nI've no intentions of secrecy.$k$p$nMPID_リオン|It will not sit well with Eirika.$k$p$nMPID_比翼エフラム|Hmm...$k$p$WmMPID_ジスト,ch08_14_Xyst_M_Normal,Face|If you're interested in the mercenary\nlife, Prince Ephraim, just say the\nword. My crew will gladly have you.$k$p$WmMPID_比翼エフラム,ch08_00_Ephraim_MM_Pair,Face|Gerik's Mercenaries are operating\nhere in Askr?$k$p$WmMPID_ジスト,ch08_14_Xyst_M_Normal,Face|That's right. In fact, we're setting out\nfrom the castle for a reconnaissance\nmission tomorrow.$k$pWe're looking to see what Askr's up\nagainst. With Commander Anna's\napproval, of course.$k$p$WmMPID_リオン,ch08_00_Ephraim_MM_Pair,Face|Mercenaries live or die by the quality\nof their information. Wise of you to\nmake that a priority.$k$p$WmMPID_ジスト,ch08_14_Xyst_M_Normal,Face|I'll take that as a compliment. So,\nhow about it, Prince? Want to\ncome along?$k$p$WmMPID_比翼エフラム,ch08_00_Ephraim_MM_Pair,Face|Absolutely.$k$pHowever, I insist that you think of me\nas one of your own. I want no special\ntreatment on account of my title.$k$p$nMPID_リオン|Ephraim! Surely a weighty decision of\nthis kind warrants a little caution!$k$p$WmMPID_ジスト,ch08_14_Xyst_M_Normal,Face|Done deal. And look at that—seems\nyour new crewmates have arrived.$k$pListen up, everyone! This is Ephraim.\nHe'll be joining us tomorrow on a\ntrial basis.$k$p$WmMPID_ユアン,ch08_15_Ewan_M_Normal,Face|Hey, he's got the same name as the\nPrince of Renais! Kind of looks a bit\nlike him too.$k$p$WmMPID_テティス,ch08_16_Tethys_F_Normal,Face|What an interesting development!\nI'm Tethys. Welcome to the crew.$k$p$WmMPID_マリカ,ch08_11_Marica_F_Normal,Face|Hello.$k$p$WmMPID_比翼エフラム,ch08_00_Ephraim_MM_Pair,Face|Good to meet you. I intend to give\nthis my all, but don't hesitate to\nput me in my place if I deserve it.$k$p$nMPID_リオン|I'm sorry, friend, but I can't let you\ndo this alone. I'm coming with you.$k$p$nMPID_比翼エフラム|Are you sure?$k$p$nMPID_リオン|Someone has to help you figure out\nhow to explain this to Eirika.$k$p$WmMPID_ジスト,ch08_14_Xyst_M_Normal,Face|Welcome aboard, then, both of you.\nAnd with introductions out of the\nway... Let's prepare to move out.$k$p$WmMPID_比翼エフラム,ch08_00_Ephraim_MM_Pair,Face|Now to see just how far I can get\nin this world with lance alone...$k$p"
