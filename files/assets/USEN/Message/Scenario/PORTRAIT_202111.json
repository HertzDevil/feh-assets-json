What\nare you going to do, stab my foot?$k$p$WmMPID_マーシャ,ch09_25_Masha_F_Normal,Face|Yes, ma'am! I mean—no, ma'am!\nHiyah!$k$p$WmMPID_タニス,ch09_12_Tanis_F_Normal,Face|Pathetic! With stamina like that, you'd\nnever survive a real battle! I'm adding\n200 push-ups to your regimen.$k$pThe Holy Guard does not tolerate\nweaklings. And don't think you can\nget out of this with a letter again!$k$p$WmMPID_マーシャ,ch09_25_Masha_F_Normal,Face|Eeek! Yes, D-Deputy Commander!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Wow. Tanith sure is passionate\nabout getting Marcia into fighting\nform, isn't she?$k$p$WmMPID_ステラ,ch09_26_Stella_F_Normal,Face|Even among the Begnion Holy Guard,\nLady Tanith is extraordinarily capable.\nFew pegasus knights are her equal.$k$pAs deputy commander, the burden\nof protecting Empress Sanaki must\nweigh heavily on her shoulders.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Oh, you mean the Holy Guard that\nSigrun commands? They're really\nnice!$k$p$WmMPID_ステラ,ch09_26_Stella_F_Normal,Face|The very same. Though they are far\nfrom Begnion, it is clear that the\nHoly Guard remain ever vigilant.$k$pTheir sense of duty is admirable.\nI'm sure I could learn a thing or\ntwo from such dedication.$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_マーシャ,ch09_25_Masha_F_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|Oh, crackers... I thought that torture\nwould never end...$k$pCan my luck get any worse? Even\nafter getting summoned to a whole\nother world, nothing's changed.$k$pSeriously, how am I STILL getting\nhounded by the deputy commander?\nHow the heck is that fair?!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Great work today, Marcia!$k$p$WmMPID_マーシャ,ch09_25_Masha_F_Normal,Face|Oh, Princess Sharena and Astrid!\nYou...didn't see all that earlier, right?\nThat would be way too embarrassing.$k$p$WmMPID_ステラ,ch09_26_Stella_F_Normal,Face|Not at all. I dare say you held up\nquite well, given what I've heard\nabout Lady Tanith's training regimen.$k$pI see the Holy Guard's reputation\nis well-deserved. It makes me want\nto train even harder!$k$p$WmMPID_マーシャ,ch09_25_Masha_F_Normal,Face|Ha... I've only got 147 push-ups left.\nYou can get started on that training\nright now by taking over for me.$k$pWhew! I'm tuckered out.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Hmm... Oh, how about this? Alfonse\nmentioned needing to take care of\nsome bandits the other day.$k$pWhy don't we handle it for him?\nIt'd be helping the Order, and\nhelping us train!$k$p$WmMPID_マーシャ,ch09_25_Masha_F_Normal,Face|Sure, whatever. I'm about to pass\nout here...$k$pDrop by the barracks when you\nneed me, but fair warning: I'll be\ncounting sheep for a while.$k$p$WmMPID_ステラ,ch09_26_Stella_F_Normal,Face|I'm not ready to turn in just yet, but\nI'll see you two later. Take care!$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_ステラ,ch09_26_Stella_F_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|...I may be a knight, but without any\nreal experience, is it really right to\ncall myself one?$k$pI'll have to train twice as hard as\nMarcia to even have a hope of\nmaking up for lost time!$k$pWait, what's this on the ground?\nDid somebody drop it?$k$pIt's some kind of notebook... But\nwho could it belong to?$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_タニス,ch09_12_Tanis_F_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|Now then, time to... What the—?!\nWhere did my notebook go? I know\nI had it this morning!$k$pI must have dropped it, but where?\nIf that notebook falls into the wrong\nhands... Goddess help me.$k$p"
