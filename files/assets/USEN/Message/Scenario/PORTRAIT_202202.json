It seems we took care of that!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Is everyone all right?$k$p$WmMPID_開花イドゥン,ch02_14_Idenn_F_Bloom01,Face|Yes... I am all right.$k$p$WmMPID_ヒュウ,ch02_35_Hugh_M_Normal,Face|Phew. It's been a while since I've\nseen Nana work her elder magic, but\nit sure is incredible.$k$pSeriously Nana, couldn't you have\njust saved the Kingdom of Askr from\ndanger on your own?$k$p$WmMPID_ニイメ,ch02_36_Nimue_F_Normal,Face|What foolish nonsense are you on\nabout? Trying to cut corners... It's\ntime you start taking things seriously.$k$p$WmMPID_ヒュウ,ch02_35_Hugh_M_Normal,Face|Nana, come on! I'm your grandson.\nDon't be so mean to me in front of all\nthese people from other worlds!$k$p$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|Hmm...$k$p$WmMPID_ヒュウ,ch02_35_Hugh_M_Normal,Face|Huh? What's the matter, Cath?\nYou've got a major wrinkle going on\nbetween your eyes.$k$p$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|Oh... Um, can I talk to you for a\nminute? It's about Idunn. Don't you\nthink she's kind of...strange?$k$p$WmMPID_ヒュウ,ch02_35_Hugh_M_Normal,Face|Strange? Well, I was just thinking\nabout how her eyes are different\ncolors, and they're real pretty...$k$p$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|That's not what I meant! I...I've heard\nrumors about her. They say she's,\nlike, the incarnation of dread...$k$pI've heard she has the power to\ndestroy all of Elibe, all by herself.$k$pSome people even say that she can\ncreate a bunch of terrifying dragons\nto serve at her command...$k$pIt doesn't make a lot of sense, but\nthere has to be some truth to the\nrumors, right?$k$p$WmMPID_ヒュウ,ch02_35_Hugh_M_Normal,Face|Yeah, I've heard stories. Apparently\nshe was called the Dark Priestess\nwhen she followed the king of Bern.$k$pBut if you ask me, the Idunn over\nthere is a lot different from the\nrumors. She doesn't seem too scary...$k$p$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|I wonder... Could it be that she just\nisn't fighting with her full strength?$k$pIf she's supposed to have all of this\nincredible power, why wouldn't she\nuse it to help us?$k$p$WmMPID_ヒュウ,ch02_35_Hugh_M_Normal,Face|That's a good question. If even half\nthe rumors are true, she could end\nthis war in no time.$k$p$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|I know! I'll just go ask her!$k$p$WmMPID_ヒュウ,ch02_35_Hugh_M_Normal,Face|H-hey, Cath—wait!$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|Hey, Idunn. I was just thinking, well,\nwondering really, if maybe you\nweren't using your full strength?$k$p$WmMPID_開花イドゥン,ch02_14_Idenn_F_Bloom01,Face|...$k$p$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|Oh, and I also heard rumors that you\ncan create lots of scary dragons, and\nthat you can control them.$k$p$WmMPID_開花イドゥン,ch02_14_Idenn_F_Bloom01,Face|No. No...I'm sorry. I can't...I can't use\nthose powers anymore...$k$pNo... I won't use them.$k$p$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|Idunn, wait...!$k$p$WmMPID_ヒュウ,ch02_35_Hugh_M_Normal,Face|There she goes...$k$p$WmMPID_キャス,ch02_37_Cath_F_Normal,Face|Huh. What was all that about? I was\njust asking an innocent question. Why\ndid she look so sad about it?$k$p$WmMPID_ニイメ,ch02_36_Nimue_F_Normal,Face|Hmm...$k$p"
