Fire dragons!\nWhat are you doing? This is a human\nvillage! People live here! Stop it!$k$pCan't move... Why can't I move?\nI need to stop them... Why won't\nthey listen to me?$k$pIf this keeps up, I... No! I can't...\nIf I change, I'll become a monster\njust like the other dragons!$k$pI don't want that! Stop it, please!\nBan-Ban! Mar-Mar! Help me!$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_開花チキ,ch01_10_Tiki_F_Bloom01,Face|$Fi1500|I don't want to be a monster! I don't\nwant to be a monster! I DON'T WANT\nTO BE A MONSTER!$k$pHngh... Ahh... Where am I? Is it...\nmorning? Was I sleeping? Oh,\nwhat an awful nightmare!$k$pIt's been so long. I was sure those\nbad dreams were gone forever...$k$pBut now that I'm in Askr, it looks\nlike I'm having them again. Will\nthey ever stop?$k$pWhat if they're a sign? What if they\ncome true? I don't know...$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_ハーディン,ch01_29_Hardin_M_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|I see. So you expect the summoner\nto be away on duty for some time.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|A few days at most. Are you able to\nwait that long, or do you require\n$Nu urgently?$k$p$WmMPID_ハーディン,ch01_29_Hardin_M_Normal,Face|I will wait, if I must, but I have no\ndesire to tarry. This matter concerns\nmore than merely myself.$k$pYou will recall that I, Princess Nyna,\nand Princess Elice were summoned\naround the same time.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|I do recall that, yes. So your request\nhas something to do with them?$k$p$WmMPID_ハーディン,ch01_29_Hardin_M_Normal,Face|Indeed. You and the Order of Heroes\nhave no doubt worked frequently\nwith royalty of other worlds.$k$pNyna is the sole survivor of House\nArchanea. Elice is the eldest princess\nof Altea and has the blood of Anri.$k$pEach is a powerful symbol of her\ncountry. They are inspirations to their\npeople—not common soldiers.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|I am not certain I follow. What is your\nrequest, exactly?$k$p$WmMPID_ハーディン,ch01_29_Hardin_M_Normal,Face|To return these princesses whence\nthey came. They are not meant for\nAskran battlefields.$k$p"
