And that's really what we\nneed?$k$p$WmMPID_フローラ,ch05_41_Flora_F_Normal,Face|The Order of Heroes has treated us\nwell, so I would like to host a tea\nparty for them.$k$pAnd in order to show proper respect,\nlegendary tea is a must. It will be our\nway of returning their hospitality.$k$pIf one drinks just a single cup of this\ntea, the fatigue of the day will all but\nvanish.$k$pAnd according to Commander Anna,\nit grows in this remote region of Askr.$k$p$WmMPID_オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Normal,Face|Very well, Flora! I have heard your\nstory, and I can feel the devotion\nflowing from your very soul.$k$pYou wish to soothe the exhausted\nspirits of Askr. Your heart sparkles\nwith the...the...sparkles of purity!$k$pI can be quite picky, myself, when it\ncomes to tea. And so I, Ophelia Dusk,\nshall take up your epic quest!$k$pIt is my personal mission to retrieve\nthis...miracle tea... Hmm, tea is kind of\namber in color, so...$k$pI shall retrieve this tea, henceforth\nknown as...Amberacle!$k$p$WmMPID_サイラス,ch05_42_Silas_M_Normal,Face|Right... So in other words, we're\nrepaying their kindness? If we can do\nso outside of battle, I welcome it.$k$pAllow me to accompany you. And\nperhaps Prince Alfonse can lead the\nway.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|You're still unfamiliar with the local\ngeography, so that's a good idea.$k$p$WmMPID_サイラス,ch05_42_Silas_M_Normal,Face|Excellent! We can move out at once.$k$p$WmMPID_エポニーヌ,ch05_43_Eponine_F_Normal,Face|Hmm...$k$pA knight and a prince...roaming deep\nwithin a dark forest... The way they\nhelp one another over a fallen tree...$k$pOh! But one of them trips! And the\nother is there to break his fall. I can\nsee it all so clearly!$k$pI need to watch this play out without\nbeing spotted myself... I'm merely an\nobserver, after all.$k$pMaybe I can hide in a barrel to spy on\ntheir blossoming relationship...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|We're heading into the mountains up\nnorth. It's likely we'll run into trouble,\nso we must proceed with caution.$k$p$WmMPID_オフェリア,ch05_44_Ophelia_F_Normal,Face|Worry not, young prince! As long as\nchosen heroine Ophelia Dusk is by\nyour side, all foes shall perish!$k$pHrk?! The power of dusk...within me...\nIt's overflowing! No, Ophelia, contain\nyourself...$k$pSave your dark energy for when you\ncan unleash it upon your enemies!$k$p$WmMPID_エポニーヌ,ch05_43_Eponine_F_Normal,Face|Hmm... I know this girl...and not even\nthe most talented staff user can heal\nher delusions.$k$pI suppose it's fine... As long as her\ndelusions don't get in the way of my\nown.$k$p$WmMPID_サイラス,ch05_42_Silas_M_Normal,Face|Well, let's move out. As Alfonse said,\nit can be dangerous, so stay focused.$k$p$WmMPID_フローラ,ch05_41_Flora_F_Normal,Face|Thank you for your assistance,\neveryone. We'll soon have all we\nneed for a world-class tea time!$k$p"
