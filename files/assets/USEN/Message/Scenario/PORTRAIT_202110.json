So that's the situation.$k$p$WmMPID_ザガロ,ch01_49_Zagallo_M_Normal,Face|Enemy forces appearing endlessly\nfrom other worlds...$k$p$WmMPID_ロシェ,ch01_46_Roche_M_Normal,Face|You've been fighting a difficult battle\nfor quite some time, haven't you?$k$p$WmMPID_ビラク,ch01_48_Virac_M_Normal,Face|It's not hard to understand why—an\nabundant land like this makes for\nan obvious target.$k$p$WmMPID_神階ピアニー,ch00_23_Peony_F_Normal,Face|Yes... It was for the sake of Askr that\n$Nu sent for you.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|If possible, I would like as many\nHeroes as possible to lend their\nstrength to defending Askr.$k$p...But I am aware that this request\nwill be difficult, and is for the cause\nof a country other than your own.$k$pEven so, can I ask for your\ncooperation?$k$p$WmMPID_マリス,ch01_47_Maris_F_Normal,Face|I don't give a damn about any of that.\nIf the pay's good, I'm happy to work\nfor anyone.$k$p$WmMPID_ロシェ,ch01_46_Roche_M_Normal,Face|The longer a war draws out, the more\nchildren it will leave without parents.\nWolf, don't you think...

We, the Coyote's Men,\nshall lend our aid to the Order of\nHeroes as well.$k$p$WmMPID_神階ピアニー,ch00_23_Peony_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Really?! Thank you!$k$p$WmMPID_ウルフ,ch01_45_Wolf_M_Normal,Face|But do not expect us to bend the\nknee to you. Our true allegiance lies\ntoward Lord Hardin, and him alone.$k$pWe will cooperate with you, but our\nloyalty to him will never waver.\nNow, I believe we are done here.$k$p$WmMPID_ロシェ,ch01_46_Roche_M_Normal,Face|...Hey, wait!

Hold on!$k$pE-excuse us, Prince Alfonse.$k$p$WmMPID_神階ピアニー,ch00_23_Peony_F_Normal,Face|...$k$pThey left...$k$p$WmMPID_マリス,ch01_47_Maris_F_Normal,Face|Knights often bear a lot of weight on\ntheir shoulders, but I get the feeling\nthose four have led very difficult lives.$k$p$WmMPID_神階ピアニー,ch00_23_Peony_F_Normal,Face|Right. Um, Prince Alfonse...\nIs the Hardin they admire...?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Yes. He was summoned to Askr\nbefore Wolf and the rest.$k$p...But not as the Prince Hardin they\nknew—not as the man called Coyote\nwho fought alongside Prince Marth.$k$pThe Hardin in this world fell to the\ncorruption of the Darksphere, and\nbecame the Dark Emperor...$k$p"
