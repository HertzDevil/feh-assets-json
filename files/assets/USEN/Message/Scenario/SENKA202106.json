Quantity?! You win by getting\nthe bigger fish, right?$k$p$WmMPID_水着アッシュ,ch17_15_Ashe_M_Swim21,Face|No, the winner is whoever catches\nthe most fish, obviously.$k$p$WmMPID_水着カスパル,ch17_09_Casper_M_Swim21,Face|You never said anything about that!$k$p$WmMPID_水着アッシュ,ch17_15_Ashe_M_Swim21,Face|I have no memory of you mentioning\nsize as the criteria either!$k$p$WmMPID_水着カスパル,ch17_09_Casper_M_Swim21,Face|Then how are we going to figure\nout which of us wins? ...Ugh!\nHow annoying...$k$p$WmMPID_水着アッシュ,ch17_15_Ashe_M_Swim21,Face|Hmm... Well, we could still alter the\ncompetition criteria now.$k$p$WmMPID_水着カスパル,ch17_09_Casper_M_Swim21,Face|Huh? How would we do that fairly?$k$p$WmMPID_水着アッシュ,ch17_15_Ashe_M_Swim21,Face|We'll cook our fish, and then have\neveryone else judge which of our\nfish is the tastiest!$k$p$WmMPID_水着カスパル,ch17_09_Casper_M_Swim21,Face|B-but I can't really...cook.$k$p$WmMPID_水着アッシュ,ch17_15_Ashe_M_Swim21,Face|That's no problem! I can handle all\nthe cooking. I'm pretty good, so you\nhave nothing to worry about!$k$p$WmMPID_水着カスパル,ch17_09_Casper_M_Swim21,Face|...You could just prepare my fish\nso it tastes bad. That's something\nI'm worried about!$k$p$WmMPID_水着アッシュ,ch17_15_Ashe_M_Swim21,Face|What do you take me for? I would\nnever do something so underhanded!$k$pWhat kind of person would I be if\nI were to make everyone eat gross\nfood on purpose like that?$k$p$WmMPID_水着カスパル,ch17_09_Casper_M_Swim21,Face|Hah! All right then, fine. I guess I have\nnothing to worry about! I'll go carry\nall these fish to the kitchen!$k$p$WmMPID_水着アッシュ,ch17_15_Ashe_M_Swim21,Face|Thank you. Oh, and would you mind\nif I take a few fillets back home with\nme afterward?$k$pI'm sure the cat in the pantry would\nappreciate a taste as well...$k$p$WmMPID_水着カスパル,ch17_09_Casper_M_Swim21,Face|Of course! I'm sure he'll enjoy\nthat regardless of which of our\nfish he gets to sample.$k$p"
