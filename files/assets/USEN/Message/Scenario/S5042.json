As you know,\nFáfnir's is no ordinary strength.$k$pThe source of that strength is the\nCrown of the Dvergar he bears.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Cool2|What is the Crown of the Dvergar?$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face|A crown passed down by the royal\nfamily of Niðavellir. It grants the\nstrength to protect the realm.$k$pBut even in light of its long history,\nthe strength it has granted Fáfnir\nis unprecedented.$k$pHowever, there is a treasure of\nsimilar might kept by the royal\nfamily: the sword Gramr.$k$pWith it, it might be possible to match\nFáfnir's power. But, well...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|But...what?$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Gramr is a powerful blade. But it is\nsaid that its true strength can only\nbe drawn out by one of royal blood.$k$pWith the coup d'état, the royal line\nwas ended. Even so, it may still be\nour best gamble.$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Thank you, Eitri. If that's the case,\nthen let's go get this magical sword!\nWe'll definitely need Gramr!$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Er... Wouldn't a treasure of Niðavellir\nbe in the royal palace of Niðavellir?\nThat is, won't Fáfnir be guarding it?$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face|No. Gramr isn't kept at the castle.\nIt was given to our neighboring\ncountry, Jötunheimr.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|What?! Such an important sword was\nhanded over to another country?$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face|The Niðavellir army uses seiðjárn\nweapons, so we have no use for\nthings like swords anymore.$k$pYears ago, our relationship with\nJötunheimr had devolved to such\na degree it almost led to war.$k$p$EFace_Smile|Ótr had the idea to offer them\na treasure in the name of peace,\nand Gramr was the perfect choice!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|I see... Such a course almost seems\nunthinkable now, and from Ótr too,\nno less...$k$pThat is good news for us though.\nMuch better than trying to steal\nthe sword from Fáfnir himself.$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face|I leave the negotiations with\nJötunheimr to you.$k$pIf you do manage to claim the blade,\nbring it back to me, and I will do\nwhat I can to help you further.$k$p$EFace_Smile|The power of that royal treasure\nmay prove useful in my research\ngoing forward.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Cool|It sure is nice to have the foremost\nexpert in seiðjárn on our side! You\ncan count on us!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|All right, let's make haste\nto Jötunheimr.$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face|Yes! We'll be back with Gramr in\nno time, Eitri! Just watch!$k$p$EFace_Smile|Now, off to Jötunheimr!$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face_Anger|...Reginn, wait. There is something\nI would like to ask you before you\nleave... Have we not met before?$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face|I've seen you around the castle!\nBut this is the first time I've spoken\nto you directly that I recall.$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face|I see... Sorry to ask such a strange\nquestion as you're about to leave.\nYou're free to go. But be careful.$k$p$Sbs150|"
