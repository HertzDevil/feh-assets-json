What\nbrings you here, my dear?$k$p$WmMPID_トール,ch00_22_Tor_F_Normal,Face|I scented one of your foul schemes.$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face_Smile|It's so nice that you recognize\nmy genius... Even if you can't\nquite grasp it.$k$p$EFace|These lost, defeated souls that\nwander the realms... I just want\nto give them a fighting chance.$k$pI had the thought to scoop them\nup together.

You must\nknow that I will be forced to report\nthis scheme.$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face|Oh my. Bound by responsibility...\nThat's you all over, isn't it?$k$p$WmMPID_トール,ch00_22_Tor_F_Normal,Face_Cool|Don't toy with me, Loki.$k$pThere is work to be done, yet you\nplay, knowing full well your duties\nare far too important to ignore.$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face|Yes, yes, yes... I know. Everything\nwe do is for him... He who created\neverything. Alfaðör.$k$p"
