Let me give you a little advice,\njust out of the kindness of my heart.$k$pIf you're ever thinking of taking on an\nenemy or obstacle that seems like it\nmight just be too much...

Call it one of life's mysteries.$k$pWell, if bawling my eyes out is only\ngoing to drag us down, I'll just have\nto put on a happy winter-festival face.$k$pGotta give the people what they\nwant, after all.$k$p$nMPID_双界ティアモ|All right, fair enough. Let's put on our\nbest smiles and do what we can to\nhave a nice time.$k$p$nMPID_ルーナ|Sounds good to me. Well, what are\nwe waiting for? Let's get going!$k$p"
