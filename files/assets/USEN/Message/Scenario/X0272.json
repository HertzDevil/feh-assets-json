At least now I can do away\nwith the formalities...$k$p$WmMPID_冬祭セシリア,ch02_09_Secilia_F_WinterFes18,Face|Hah, you are just as they say.$k$p$WmMPID_冬祭エフラム,ch08_00_Ephraim_M_WinterFes18,Face|All that aside, General Cecilia, I have\na question for you... Does \"Mage\nGeneral\" just mean magic general?$k$p$WmMPID_冬祭セシリア,ch02_09_Secilia_F_WinterFes18,Face|I suppose you could say that, yes...\nAlthough, I find myself teaching magic\nmore often than using it in battle.$k$pI taught Lilina some basic spells,\nfor example...$k$p$WmMPID_冬祭エフラム,ch08_00_Ephraim_M_WinterFes18,Face|Ah, so...a Mage General is mostly a\nmagic teacher, then?$k$pI suppose I do see some similarities\nbetween you and my lance instructor,\nnow that I consider it.$k$pHey, I'm no good with magic, but...\ndo you think I could learn if I studied\nunder you? I bet I could!$k$p$WmMPID_冬祭セシリア,ch02_09_Secilia_F_WinterFes18,Face|Unfortunately, no.\nYou have no talent for magic.$k$p$WmMPID_冬祭エフラム,ch08_00_Ephraim_M_WinterFes18,Face|...N-none at all? Oh. Well...I'd be\nlying if I said that wasn't what I had\nexpected to hear.$k$p$WmMPID_冬祭セシリア,ch02_09_Secilia_F_WinterFes18,Face|Forgive my bluntness, but it would\nbe cruel of me to lead you down that\npath knowing it would be a dead end.$k$pEveryone has a role, though, so\nworry not. You, after all, are meant\nfor the throne...$k$pAnd there your natural talent as a\nleader of people will truly blossom.$k$pBut for now, we must attend to the\nmatter at hand. What are your next\norders, Commander?$k$p"
