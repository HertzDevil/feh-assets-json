It's a lot to\ntake in, I know, but you'll learn to find\nyour way around, I'm sure.$k$pDon't hesitate to ask for anything you\nmight need, OK? We've got plenty of\nsupplies to go around.$k$p$WmMPID_フォルス,ch10_21_Forsyth_M_Normal,Face|Commander Anna, your generosity is\noverwhelming. My sincerest thanks\nfor the warm welcome.$k$p$WmMPID_シルク,ch10_23_Silque_F_Normal,Face|I must admit that I had my doubts\nwhen we were first summoned\nto this foreign place.$k$pNow that I have seen how kind you all\nare, however, I can say that it is my\npleasure to be here.$k$p$WmMPID_外伝カチュア,ch10_20_Katua_F_Normal,Face|I know they're from different worlds,\nbut seeing other Pallas and Ests is\nstill difficult to get used to.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|It's an adjustment, for sure, but don't\nworry. You'll feel right at home in the\nOrder of Heroes before you know it!$k$pFor now, take some time to settle in.\nI'm looking forward to seeing what\neach of you can do on the battlefield!$k$p$WmMPID_パイソン,ch10_22_Python_M_Normal,Face|...$k$p$WmMPID_フォルス,ch10_21_Forsyth_M_Normal,Face|That gathering in the great hall was\nquite a sight to behold, wasn't it?$k$p$WmMPID_シルク,ch10_23_Silque_F_Normal,Face|Yes. All of those Heroes, as if pulled\nstraight from the pages of history...\nIt took my breath away.$k$p$WmMPID_フォルス,ch10_21_Forsyth_M_Normal,Face|To reunite with Sir Clive and the\nZofian royalty would be privilege\nenough for me...$k$pBut to stand in the presence of the\nHero-King of Altea is beyond my\nwildest expectations.$k$pCatria, you fought alongside the\nHero-King in Archanea, did you not?$k$p$WmMPID_外伝カチュア,ch10_20_Katua_F_Normal,Face|I did. It was Prince Marth who saved\nMacedon, the kingdom I served.$k$pHe is no less exemplary in Askr now\nthan he was in Archanea then.$k$p$WmMPID_フォルス,ch10_21_Forsyth_M_Normal,Face|I can think of no higher honor than to\ntake up arms alongside the greatest\nHeroes of legend.$k$pThe prospect must surely excite even\nyou, Python!$k$p$WmMPID_パイソン,ch10_22_Python_M_Normal,Face|Honor, eh? Big deal. Honor ever kept\nyou warm? Filled your belly?$k$pCrivens, if you had any sense, you'd\nlet nobles solve their own problems\ninstead of begging them to use you.$k$pBut I guess you think if you do their\ndirty work they'll let you join their\nlittle club, eh? You never change.$k$p$WmMPID_フォルス,ch10_21_Forsyth_M_Normal,Face|Python, wait! Ah, it seems I'm not the\nonly one stuck in my ways...$k$p$WmMPID_外伝カチュア,ch10_20_Katua_F_Normal,Face|...$k$p"
