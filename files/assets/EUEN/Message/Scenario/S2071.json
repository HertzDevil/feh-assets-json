There is a ceremony in\nNifl called the Rite of Frost...$k$pIt is so powerful that it can extinguish\neven the flames of Múspell.$k$pThe last to perform the ritual was my\nmother, in her fight against Surtr. She\nlost her life that day...$k$pThanks to that, I am sure that Surtr\nthinks he is untouchable. That is\nsimply not true.$k$pInstead, I believe it was a ploy of my\nmother's, designed to throw Surtr off\nhis guard.$k$pShe conducted the rite without the\nnecessary artifacts, you see...$k$pBut I have one of them with me. It is\ncalled the Snjársteinn. And the other,\nwell... It is in your hands already.$k$pIt is the divine weapon, Breidablik.\nYour weapon holds a very special\npower—it can control the worlds.$k$pWhen we meet, I will entrust the\nstone to you. And with it, you will be\nable to guide us.$k$pIt will expose to us the path to the true\nRite of Frost and grant us the power\nwe need to defeat Surtr.$k$p$Sbs150|"
