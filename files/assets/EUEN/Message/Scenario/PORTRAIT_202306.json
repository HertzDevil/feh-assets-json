Well done—I'm impressed by\nyour improvement lately.$k$pYou have come a long way since we\nfirst crossed blades in the arena.$k$p$WmMPID_開花フィル,ch02_01_Fir_F_Bloom01,Face|Thank you! This new world is a little\noverwhelming, if I'm honest. It's a\ncomfort to spar with a familiar face.$k$p$WmMPID_ノア,ch02_42_Noah_M_Normal,Face|Agreed. I am grateful that Father Saul\nand Dorothy are here as well.$k$p$WmMPID_開花フィル,ch02_01_Fir_F_Bloom01,Face|Sir Noah, are you all right? I notice\nyou're favoring your left leg.$k$pCome to think of it, you were favoring\nit while we were sparring as well...$k$p$WmMPID_ノア,ch02_42_Noah_M_Normal,Face|So you noticed. Yes, reluctant as I am\nto admit it, I sprained my foot in a\nrecent battle.$k$pFather Saul healed it with his staff,\nbut it's not fully back to normal yet.$k$p$WmMPID_開花フィル,ch02_01_Fir_F_Bloom01,Face|Oh, no! That's why I won?! I took\nadvantage of your injured state?!$k$p$WmMPID_ノア,ch02_42_Noah_M_Normal,Face|Fir...$k$p$WmMPID_開花フィル,ch02_01_Fir_F_Bloom01,Face|I'm so sorry! I should have realized.\nTo think I'd have called that a\nvictory—how dishonorable of me!$k$pThis is not the path I want to walk.\nWhat a fool I've been—worse than a\nfool, a coward!$k$p$WmMPID_ノア,ch02_42_Noah_M_Normal,Face|Hold on a second, Fir! Ah... She must\nbe very upset to storm off like that.$k$pI do hope she learns not to overthink\nthings so much. It's going to hurt\nher technique...$k$p"
