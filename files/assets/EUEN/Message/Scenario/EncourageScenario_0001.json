Of course I'd like your\ninput too, $Nu.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|How can we help, Commander Anna?$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|I've heard word that an incredibly\npowerful foe appeared in another\nworld, and they seek our aid.$k$pThe threat is too great for the\nHeroes of their world to face\non their own.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Oh! They're in trouble, so they ask\nfor help from another world...$k$p$EFace_Smile|Just like we do!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Normal2|You have a point there. We have\nbrought the Heroes helping us here\nto join us from other worlds...$k$pNow it's time for us to help them\nin return!$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|I'm glad to hear you support the idea.\nHowever, the situation is a bit more\ncomplicated than that...$k$p$EFace_Anger|Under the circumstances, we can't\nall rush into battle.$k$pOur ability to help is limited\nto sending reinforcements.$k$pSo, we have to send support forces\nout to the four Heroes who have\nalready engaged the enemy.$k$pOur foe is a general with a vast army\nunder their command.$k$p$EFace_Pain2|We don't know the exact numbers,\njust that they are an overwhelming\nforce to face.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|Facing such numbers, will our\nreinforcements be enough?$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|That is another complication. The call\nfor aid is being heard by the Orders\nof Heroes from many other worlds.$k$p$EFace_Smile|And the support forces they send\nare rallying behind the four Heroes\non the ground there.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Even Orders of Heroes from other\nworlds are joining in to help, then!\nThat's a comforting thought!$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|The support forces being deployed\nare outfitted with Guardian Shields,\nwhich can be crucial defense.$k$pThe Guardian Shield can be used\nfor protection, but it can be used\nonly up to three times per battle.$k$pTiming use of Guardian Shields will\nbe critical to success.$k$p$EFace_Pain2|If many Guardian Shields are used\nby the support forces at once...$k$p$EFace_Cool|A power that will protect the entire\narmy will be unleased—the Skjaldborg\nshield wall!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Wow! That sounds amazing! I want\nto see it for myself!$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|The more support we send, the\ndeeper into the enemy's forces\nour Heroes can cut.$k$pBut the more our forces extend\nthemselves, the greater the danger\nof the enemy turning the tables.$k$pWe will have to consider our choices\ncarefully... So, in that case, it's in\nyour hands, $Nu!$k$p$EFace_Smile|We're counting on you!$k$p"
