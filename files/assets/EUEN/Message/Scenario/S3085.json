Then is there an older\nSharena here?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|I'm afraid not...$k$pAccording to what I've read, the\nSharena that lived here has already\npassed away.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|WHAT? I died?$k$pBut...looking at the state of this\nplace...it's hardly surprising.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Did your reading shed any light on\nthe cause of all this destruction?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|I located some rather intriguing\npassages.

What could\nthat be?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|It's not clear. But it seems to be\nthe key to a ritual Askr and Embla\nperformed to combat Hel.$k$p\"The Heart's Rite is the only\nmethod that may bring the\nruler of the dead low...\"$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|Now, that's what I call a clue!\nWhatever this heart may be, it\nspells Hel's defeat, it seems.$k$pWe have our objective, I'd say.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|Not so fast, Commander.$k$p\"Though it may slay the ruler of\nthe dead, it too spells our end...$k$p\"With every pulse, it steals one\nlife.$k$p\"And so, death ravaged us in an\neyeblink... First towns fell, and\nultimately all the land...$k$p\"People, beasts, any that drew\nbreath—death came for all.$k$p\"Mighty dragon Askr, forgive us this\nsin, unforgivable though it may be.$k$p\"We beg of you one thing only:\nsalvation.\"$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Are you saying that THIS is what\nhappened here?$k$pTo defeat Hel, our Askr would need\nto become like this one?$k$pIf that is true... It's a cost that is far\ntoo great to contemplate.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|Terrible...$k$p$Sbs150|"
