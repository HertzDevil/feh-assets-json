Where\nthe hell are we gonna run to?!\nAin't nowhere to go!$k$p$WmMPID_ユーリス,ch17_60_Euris_M_Normal,Face|We'll figure it out as we go. For\nnow, anywhere is better than\nthis so-called Order of Heroes.$k$pI don't know about the rest of you,\nbut I just can't stomach the idea of\nbeing used as disposable pawns.$k$p$WmMPID_ハピ,ch17_63_Hapi_F_Normal,Face|Askr or Abyss... Doesn't make\nmuch of a difference to me.$k$p$WmMPID_バルタザール,ch17_61_Balthazar_M_Normal,Face|Well, I'm willing to give gettin' outta\nhere a shot. Hapi, mind sighing in\nthe castle?$k$pIf we get some monsters inside,\nmaking a break for it during the\ncommotion should be no sweat at all!$k$p$WmMPID_コンスタンツェ,ch17_62_Constanze_F_Normal,Face|Ahahaha! As for me, I have no\ndesire to stay in such an absurdly\nbright place!$k$pA dim place of silence and elegance...\nThat is the only appropriate location\nfor me, Constance von Nuvelle!$k$p$WmMPID_ユーリス,ch17_60_Euris_M_Normal,Face|Last I checked, Abyss is a pretty far\ncry from elegant...$k$p$WmMPID_バルタザール,ch17_61_Balthazar_M_Normal,Face|Sooo... Do any of you have ideas for\nwhere we can hide? Not like we can\njust hole up in the pantry...$k$pWe need somewhere that's fairly\ndark, doesn't get any visitors, and\nis big enough for all four of us.$k$p$WmMPID_ザカリア影,ch90_02_FighterAX_M_Normal,Face|In that case... How about\nthe Great Library of Askr?\nMmph mmph...$k$p$WmMPID_ユーリス,ch17_60_Euris_M_Normal,Face|Those wings... Is this some kind of\nmonster? It's certainly not the ugliest\none I've had the pleasure to meet...$k$p$WmMPID_ハピ,ch17_63_Hapi_F_Normal,Face|...Hey, don't look at me. It's not like\nevery monster that shows up is\nfrom me sighing, you know.$k$p$WmMPID_ルピナス,ch00_28_Lupine_F_Normal,Face|I'm Mirabilis, and I'm...*yawn*...not\na monster. I'm an álfr.$k$pI was flying around while sleeping,\nand I just happened to overhear\nyour conversation, so... *yaaaawn*$k$p$WmMPID_コンスタンツェ,ch17_62_Constanze_F_Normal,Face|You mentioned a Great Library of\nAskr earlier, did you not? Can you\ntell us what manner of place that is?$k$p$WmMPID_ルピナス,ch00_28_Lupine_F_Normal,Face|Mm? You need a place to hide, right?\nWell...*yawn*...it's dark, doesn't get a\nlot of visitors...*yawn*...and it's big.$k$pThe Great Library of Askr is probably\nthe perfect place to take a nap...and\nto hide, I suppose...$k$pAll right, that's all from me... Zzzz...$k$p$WmMPID_バルタザール,ch17_61_Balthazar_M_Normal,Face|Wh-whoa, she just flew off while\nasleep. Is she gonna be all right?$k$p$WmMPID_ユーリス,ch17_60_Euris_M_Normal,Face|The Great Library of Askr, huh... We\nshould slip in before dawn breaks.\nThen we'll figure out our next step!$k$p"
