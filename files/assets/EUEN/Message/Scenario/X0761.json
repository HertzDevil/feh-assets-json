Everyone seems to be\nhaving a wonderful time.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ男,ch05_00_Kamui_M_Halloween22,Face|I once took part in a similar festival in\nNohr. The motifs are a little different,\nbut the costumes are just as flashy.$k$pIt's interesting to see what people\nfrom other worlds come up with.\nHang on... Do you hear that?$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ女,ch05_19_Kamui_F_Halloween22,Face|Sounds like a flute. I wonder who the\nplayer could be.

Hello.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ女,ch05_19_Kamui_F_Halloween22,Face|You're a very talented musician, Nils.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ男,ch05_00_Kamui_M_Halloween22,Face|How come no one's here to listen?\nA gifted performance like this\ndeserves an audience.$k$pThere's a festival going on right now.\nI'll bet if you took the stage, listeners\nwould come running.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロニルス,ch03_28_Nils_M_Halloween22,Face|Maybe they would. I'm not interested\nin that, though.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ女,ch05_19_Kamui_F_Halloween22,Face|Really? I'm surprised. As I recall, you\nwere never shy about performing\nduring your travels...$k$p$WmMPID_ハロニルス,ch03_28_Nils_M_Halloween22,Face|I guess. It wasn't all fun and games\nback then either, though. We had\nour share of problems.$k$pTo tell you the truth, even though\nI've met plenty of nice people, I'm\nstill uncomfortable around humans.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ男,ch05_00_Kamui_M_Halloween22,Face|I understand where you're coming\nfrom. It is a shame, though.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ女,ch05_19_Kamui_F_Halloween22,Face|Agreed. We should all be comfortable\nenjoying the harvest festival, dragons\nand humans alike.$k$pIf there's anything we can do to help,\nNils, just say the word.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ男,ch05_00_Kamui_M_Halloween22,Face|I have an idea. If you're not ready for\na human audience, why don't we\ngather up some dragons?$k$p$WmMPID_ハロニルス,ch03_28_Nils_M_Halloween22,Face|I...guess that would be fine? I don't\nknow, I haven't met too many\nother dragons.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ男,ch05_00_Kamui_M_Halloween22,Face|There are tons of them participating\nin the festival. You'll feel right at\nhome, I'm sure of it!$k$p$WmMPID_ハロカムイ女,ch05_19_Kamui_F_Halloween22,Face|Sounds like a plan to me. All right,\nlet's go find some dragons.$k$p$WmMPID_ハロニルス,ch03_28_Nils_M_Halloween22,Face|OK, if you insist...$k$p$Sbs150|"
