The Order of\nHeroes, I mean...$k$p$EFace_Cool|...And now that you know, get to\nwor—err... Let's keep testing!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain2|Ugh... I suppose if it's for the\nOrder of Heroes...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Oh, wow—look at this book, you two!\nIt looks like it's quite old. Hmm...\nLet's see...$k$p$EFace_Anger|Wait a minute... Marth? Caeda? Leif,\nAlm... Roy... There are so many\nHeroes mentioned in here!$k$pCommander, wh-what is this book?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Ooh! I want to see! Does it have\nany pictures?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|Wait—Sharena! Be careful!$k$p$SspSE_EFFECT_ICEWALL_BREAK01|$SspSE_SPA_DIVE1|$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Oh no! There goes the cleaner!\nAnd all on one book too... What\na waste.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|I-I'm so sorry! Can we dry the\nbook out? What do we do?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|It will be fine, Sharena. We'll\nsimply allow the book to dry, and\nit will be almost good as new.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|Right! We'll just open it up to\nthe wet pages so they can dry more\neasily, and...$k$p$EFace_Pain|...Huh?! Th-the pages... They're\nall...blank! And not just the wet\nones—ALL of them!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|What?! How is that possible!$k$p$EFace_Smile|You said it could remove any stain,\nbut I never expected it could remove\ndried ink from a page!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|...This can't be right.$k$p$EFace|Commander, is that really just a\nsimple cleaning solution?$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|I thought so... But it IS from another\nworld, so it's possible it behaves\nstrangely here in Askr...$k$pThere could be some magic in it that\nhelps it to remove stains...$k$p$EFace_Cool|But...the bigger problem here is that\nthis book is the Heroes' Saga.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|What's...the Heroes' Saga?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Yeah, what is this book exactly?$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Well, you know the Heroes that\n$Nu summons...$k$pIt's a collection of tales and\ndescriptions of their worlds.$k$pWithout it, we won't be able to\nfamiliarize ourselves with their\nworlds and their histories.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Oh no! That's terrible! I want\nto know all there is to know\nabout the Heroes!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|They are out there risking their\nlives to help us with our fight.$k$pIt would be extremely rude of us\nto not bother to get to know their\nworlds' stories as best we can!$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Hm... Then we all agree.$k$p$EFace|I am hereby announcing a new\nmission for all active members of\nthe Order of Heroes!$k$p$EFace_Cool|We will send scout parties to\nthe other worlds and recover the\nlore lost from the Heroes' Saga!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|What?! You want US to do it?$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|Of course! And we'll need the\nassistance of the Heroes too.$k$pHmm... And I bet we can recover\nimportant lore faster if we send out\nthose familiar with the world!$k$p$EFace_Smile|Now... Let's get out there and\nrecover those lost sagas and\nrestore our historical records!$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|A-are we historians now? ...Wow!\nThis is great! I've already got a bit\nof experience.$k$p$EFace_Smile|All right! Let's do this, Alfonse!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Cool|Hmph...$k$p$EFace_Smile|Why do I get the feeling this will\nbe a bigger task than we expect...$k$p"
