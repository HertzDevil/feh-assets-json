And even\nnow, I'm not sure I do.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|$w0|It's just as it seems, Commander...\nThis is the Aether Keep left behind by\nLíf, first king of Askr.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|$w0|It's just as mother used to tell us\nwhen we were little. A castle that\nflies as freely as a bird...$k$pSeeing it is like seeing a dream!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|$w0|You're right, Sharena. It's just as\nmother said. I was certain those were\nmere fairy tales...$k$pNever did I imagine we would find it\nlying dormant all the way out here.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|$w0|I can't help but wonder about the\nsource who gave us the information\nthat led us here...$k$pJust who could it have been?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Anger|$w0|Hmm...$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Smile|$w0|Alfonse! Commander Anna! Over\nhere—you can see the whole thing!$k$p$EFace|It's been untouched for so long, it's\npractically in ruins.

It was a battle for\npower over the heavens.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Cool2|$w0|Amazing! They waged battle so high\nup?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|$w0|That's right. It's also said they\nemployed special weaponry, both\noffensive as well as defensive.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|$w0|Weapons on a castle? That sounds\nincredible! Do you think there are any\nstill lying around?$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|$w0|Good question, Sharena. I'm sure\nany we can salvage will come in\nhandy later.$k$pLet's give this place a proper look\nright away.$k$p"
