Have there been\nany changes in Prince Alfonse and\nand Commander Anna's conditions?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Our healers are doing everything\nthey can, but...it's still too early to\ntell if they'll make it...$k$p$WmMPID_セイズ,ch00_46_Seith_F_Normal,Face_Anger|If Gullveig's invasion is allowed to\ncontinue at this pace...$k$pAll who stand against her will be\nutterly destroyed.$k$p$WmMPID_神階ピアニー,ch00_23_Peony_F_Normal,Face_Anger|The Order of Heroes is the final\nhope for the people, but what can\nwe do against such power?$k$p$WmMPID_アシュ,ch00_39_Ash_F_Normal,Face_Pain|The enemy's assaults grow fiercer by\nthe day. We can barely hold the line,\nmuch less engage in a counterattack.$k$pOur forces have only been further\nenfeebled by the loss of Commander\nAnna and Prince Alfonse.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|How can we possibly win against\nsuch a powerful foe?$k$p$WmMPID_セイズ,ch00_46_Seith_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Do not give in to despair, children\nof Midgard. Gullveig is not as\nunstoppable as she seems.$k$pIt is possible that we have already\ndefeated her a number of times.$k$p$WmMPID_神階エイル,ch00_20_Eir_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Are you implying that she has\nbeen reversing time to ensure\nour defeat?$k$p$WmMPID_セイズ,ch00_46_Seith_F_Normal,Face_Anger|I shall venture once more to the\nrealm of light, Vanaheimr.$k$pThere, I will continue my search\nfor a way through which we may\nput an end to Gullveig's terror.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Seiðr...good luck. We will hold\nsteady in our defenses here while\nyou're away.$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face|I'd be happy to escort you to the\ngates of light, Seiðr! We can't have\nyou getting lost again, after all.$k$p$WmMPID_セイズ,ch00_46_Seith_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Oh, um...yes. Thank you.$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_フィヨルム,ch00_06_Fjorm_F_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|I wonder if there is a way we can\nhelp fight back too so Seiðr doesn't\nhave to shoulder the burden alone...$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙ルフレ男,ch04_07_Reflet_M_ELECTION023,Face|Princess Sharena, could we borrow\nyou for a moment?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Certainly. Oh, were you all\nholding a strategy meeting?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙セネリオ,ch09_02_Senerio_M_ELECTION023,Face|Indeed. We've been theorizing\na more...unconventional way to\ncounter Gullveig.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|I'm willing to listen to any plan\nat this point. Let's hear it.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙ルフレ男,ch04_07_Reflet_M_ELECTION023,Face|I should warn you that this is less of\na plan and more of a gamble.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙セネリオ,ch09_02_Senerio_M_ELECTION023,Face|We recommend summoning\nGullveig as a Hero and binding\nher to a contract.$k$pThen, we can pit her against the\nenemy version of Gullveig.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|What? Is that even possible?$k$p$WmMPID_アウグスト,ch07_17_August_M_Normal,Face|Such a confrontation should be at\nleast evenly matched. Fighting fire\nwith fire, as it were.$k$p$WmMPID_サイアス,ch07_05_Cyas_M_Normal,Face|I'm uncertain whether the summoner\nwill be able to establish a connection,\nbut we must try.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙ルフレ男,ch04_07_Reflet_M_ELECTION023,Face|Of course, the full force of the Order\nwould also be behind the summoned\nGullveig. She would not fight alone.$k$p$WmMPID_ユリシーズ,ch11_31_Ulysses_M_Normal,Face|Do also consider that, should this fail,\nwe may find ourselves pitted against\ntwo Golden Seers instead of one.$k$pIn that situation, we may as well don\nour brightest smiles and try to win\nthe day with loquaciousness, hm?$k$p$WmMPID_ヒューベルト,ch17_06_Hubert_M_Normal,Face|Oh, don't worry. While you are busy\ngreeting oblivion with a smile, the rest\nof us will think of something useful.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|What do you think,\n$Nu?$k$p$EFace|Wait, I know that look... You'll do it?\nIf you're sure... Thank you.$k$pIt seems like the fate of Askr is once\nagain in the hands of our summoner.\nWe're counting on you.$k$p$Fo1500,0,0,0,255|$WmMPID_総選挙カムイ女,ch05_19_Kamui_F_ELECTION023,Face|$Fi1500|Robin, I heard you intend to move\nforward with the plan to summon\nanother version of Gullveig.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙ルフレ男,ch04_07_Reflet_M_ELECTION023,Face|Yes. It's a dangerous play, but it's the\nonly real chance we have.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙カムイ女,ch05_19_Kamui_F_ELECTION023,Face|If it's so risky, why don't we at least\nwait for Seiðr to return? Maybe she'll\nfind something in Vanaheimr.$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙セネリオ,ch09_02_Senerio_M_ELECTION023,Face|The enemy is at our doorstep\nand you want to wait?$k$pNo. The summoning has already\nbegun. If this plan is going to fail,\nwe will know shortly.$k$p$Fo1500,255,255,255,255|$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|$Fi1500|$w0|That light... Did it work? Did you\nactually summon Gullveig?$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙カムイ女,ch05_19_Kamui_F_ELECTION023,Face|I-I can't believe it! The plan worked...$k$p$WmMPID_総選挙グルヴェイグ,ch00_47_Gullveig_F_ELECTION023,Face|Hm... How interesting...$k$p"
