    "value": "$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Great job, everyone! Not only did we\nfinish our mission, but no one was\nhurt! I'm so glad.$k$p$WmMPID_オーシン,ch07_07_Othin_M_Normal,Face|You kidding? Come on, like those\nbandits had half a chance against the\nFiana Freeblades!$k$p$WmMPID_タニア,ch07_08_Tania_F_Normal,Face|Oh yeah? They looked like they had\nbetter odds than that against you...$k$pAt least until Mareeta bailed you out.$k$p$WmMPID_マリータ,ch07_06_Mareeta_F_Normal,Face|That was nothing. Credit my mother's\ntactics for putting me in position.$k$p$WmMPID_エーヴェル,ch07_09_Evel_F_Normal,Face|The credit goes to our teamwork\nmost of all.$k$pBut let's delay the celebration until\nwe've reached the castle. Another\nambush could find us at any time.$k$p$WmMPID_タニア,ch07_08_Tania_F_Normal,Face|...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|What is it, Tanya? Have you spotted\nsomething in the wilderness?$k$p$WmMPID_タニア,ch07_08_Tania_F_Normal,Face|No, nothing like that. I'm just noticing\nthat this land looks...worked.$k$p$WmMPID_エーヴェル,ch07_09_Evel_F_Normal,Face|Good eye. The slope of that hill there\ndoes look man-made.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Now that you mention it, I do believe\nthis area was plotted for farmland.$k$pIt seems that banditry and a flooding\nriver have put those plans on hold for\nthe time being, however.$k$p$WmMPID_マリータ,ch07_06_Mareeta_F_Normal,Face|That explains why it's abandoned.$k$p$WmMPID_オーシン,ch07_07_Othin_M_Normal,Face|Shame to let all this good sunlight\nand fresh water go to waste.$k$p$WmMPID_タニア,ch07_08_Tania_F_Normal,Face|You know... That's a great point!\nPrince Alfonse! Why don't we\nhandle this place ourselves?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|You want to use the Heroes...to\nclear the land?$k$p$WmMPID_タニア,ch07_08_Tania_F_Normal,Face|Think of what we could build... Not\njust a farm—a whole village!$k$p$WmMPID_エーヴェル,ch07_09_Evel_F_Normal,Face|She's right. With proper irrigation and\nlogging, a village here could thrive.$k$p$WmMPID_オーシン,ch07_07_Othin_M_Normal,Face|Somebody say logging? Stand back!\nThese arms are made for chopping!$k$p$WmMPID_マリータ,ch07_06_Mareeta_F_Normal,Face|I'd be happy to help with some good,\nwholesome work like this.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Are you sure? There's no shortage of\nimportant work for Heroes.$k$p$WmMPID_タニア,ch07_08_Tania_F_Normal,Face|This is important too! And we're\nhappy to do it.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Then that settles it. Don't hesitate to\nlet us know if there is anything you\nneed, all right?$k$p$WmMPID_タニア,ch07_08_Tania_F_Normal,Face|You got it! Don't worry—we'll have\nthis place bustling in no time!$k$p"
