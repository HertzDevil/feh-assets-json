Let's fall back and regroup.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Anger|We can't just yet, Commander.

Oh, no...$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|We have to warn them or they'll be\noutflanked and surrounded!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain|We cannot abandon our allies, but at\nthe same time...we are barely holding\nour own here.$k$p$WmMPID_暴走アシュナード,ch09_15_Ashnard_M_Dark,Face|I will deal with this.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face_Pain2|King Ashnard?$k$p$WmMPID_暴走アシュナード,ch09_15_Ashnard_M_Dark,Face|Your stragglers are nearly overrun\nby superior forces, yes?
