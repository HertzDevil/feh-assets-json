So you wish to place the four\nof us under the purview of this\nso-called \"Order of Heroes,\" was it?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|For the sake of Askr and its people,\nyes. We would be honored to count\nyou as allies.$k$p$WmMPID_パリス,ch04_45_Paris_M_Normal,Face|For not only the kingdom, but also its\npeople, huh? Hmm...$k$p$WmMPID_バジーリオ,ch04_47_Basiglio_M_Normal,Face|So says His Highness. But what do\nyou make of it, Flavia?$k$p$WmMPID_フラヴィア,ch04_46_Flavia_F_Normal,Face|What any khan worth their salt would\nthink of a situation like this.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Oh! Does that mean you'll—$k$p$WmMPID_フラヴィア,ch04_46_Flavia_F_Normal,Face|Not so fast.$k$pI understand that you need warriors\nto protect your kingdom...$k$pBut just because we're warriors\ndoesn't mean we'll fight for any\ncause—or for just anyone.$k$p$WmMPID_ミリエル,ch04_44_Miriel_F_Normal,Face|A pertinent observation.$k$p$WmMPID_フラヴィア,ch04_46_Flavia_F_Normal,Face|If you think you can simply use us as\nexpendable soldiers in your war, we'll\nhave to not-so-kindly pass.$k$pIf we decided to fight for Askr, it'd be\non our own terms.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|We'd never treat Heroes like that!$k$p$WmMPID_バジーリオ,ch04_47_Basiglio_M_Normal,Face|Let's cut to the chase, lass. If you\nwant to earn our trust, you'd better\nprove yourselves on the battlefield.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Come again?$k$p$WmMPID_バジーリオ,ch04_47_Basiglio_M_Normal,Face|In Regna Ferox, we cut with our\nswords, not our words.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Wait just a minute... Are you saying\nwe need to do some kind of duel to\nthe death just to earn your respect?$k$p$WmMPID_バジーリオ,ch04_47_Basiglio_M_Normal,Face|Not to the death, no. But that makes\nthings a bit less interesting, so let's\nspice it up by splittin' into teams.$k$pSpeakin' of, I call dibs on Lon'qu.\nHe'll be the next West-Khan after\nI give up the reins, so it's only fair.$k$p$WmMPID_フラヴィア,ch04_46_Flavia_F_Normal,Face|Naturally, Priam and Miriel will be on\nour team as well. It looks like you will\nneed two more.$k$p$WmMPID_パリス,ch04_45_Paris_M_Normal,Face|Sounds like an excellent chance to\ntest my skills, so count me in.$k$p$WmMPID_ミリエル,ch04_44_Miriel_F_Normal,Face|I must protest. My allegiance lies with\nthe Shepherds, not some Feroxi\nwarmongers.$k$p$WmMPID_バジーリオ,ch04_47_Basiglio_M_Normal,Face|Oh, c'mon.... We were both just\nsummoned to Askr, right? That\npractically makes us pals!$k$p$WmMPID_フラヴィア,ch04_46_Flavia_F_Normal,Face|Then it's settled. Prince, I trust you'll\nhave a team prepared by tomorrow.$k$p$WmMPID_パリス,ch04_45_Paris_M_Normal,Face|And you'd better bring your best, or\nit'll just be a waste of my time.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|I'm not sure we— Oh, there they go...$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Are we really going to let them order\nus around like this?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|As much as I don't like it, this might\nbe the only way to earn their trust...$k$p"
