They\nseem to fascinate you so.$k$p$WmMPID_トール,ch00_22_Tor_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Do not belittle them, Loki. They\ncontain strength neither you nor I\npossess.$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face|Oh, do they? This despite the fact\nthat they aren't...real?$k$pThey may look like Heroes, but\nthey're nothing more than toys\ncreated by Alfaðör.$k$pThey're weaklings. Babies that can\nbarely walk, let alone fight.$k$p$WmMPID_トール,ch00_22_Tor_F_Normal,Face|That is the very reason I am\ninterested. They may lack power...\nbut they are filled with potential.$k$pThey work together, push\nthemselves...expend every last\ndrop of strength to grasp victory.$k$pAnd then they acquire new strength.\nWhat do they do then? Use it to take\non stronger foes...$k$p$EFace_Anger|This is what strength is. It is pure and\ntrue.$k$pAnd it is strength we will never know.\nYou could learn much if you were\nto witness their battles.$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face|Fine! Well... I do like battles that\nhave...a certain element of\nuncertainty.$k$p$EFace_Cool|Just how far can these pitiful\ndolls go? Perhaps I should take\na look.$k$p"
