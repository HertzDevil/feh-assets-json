I've never\nseen so many heroic figures all\ngathered in one place!$k$p$WmMPID_外伝パオラ,ch10_28_Paora_F_Normal,Face|It's true. I've seen many things in\nmy travels and fought my fair share\nof battles, but...$k$pBefore now, the largest battles I had\nexperienced had only a few people\nof such a caliber on either side.$k$pSeeing so many Heroes gathered\ntogether is a thrill!$k$p$WmMPID_リュート,ch10_29_Lute_M_Normal,Face|Askr may be blessed with strength\nin numbers, but that doesn't make\nit invincible. Far from it, in fact.$k$pAs we have seen, dangers continue\nstalking the kingdom even with this\nmany Heroes at its defense.$k$p$WmMPID_ティータ,ch10_30_Tita_F_Normal,Face|This many Heroes...$k$p$WmMPID_ジーク,ch10_31_Zeke_M_Normal,Face|It is unusual for you to look so\nsolemn, Tatiana... Is something\nwrong? What worries you?$k$p$WmMPID_ティータ,ch10_30_Tita_F_Normal,Face|Oh, Zeke... It's just... Well...$k$pWith all of the Heroes here, it's likely\nat least one of them knows about\nyour past, right?$k$p$WmMPID_ジーク,ch10_31_Zeke_M_Normal,Face|Perhaps...

So, you are inflicted with an\nunfortunate case of amnesia, eh?$k$p$WmMPID_ティータ,ch10_30_Tita_F_Normal,Face|I found him washed up on the shore,\non the brink of death, but I nursed\nhim back to health.$k$pEven though I restored his body,\nI couldn't heal his memory. He had\nto start over... A new life...$k$p$WmMPID_ジーク,ch10_31_Zeke_M_Normal,Face|I was unable to remember even my\nown name. Emperor Rudolf, in his\nbenevolence, gave me this one.$k$pIt was also he who recognized the\none vestige of my former life: my\nskill with a lance.$k$p$WmMPID_外伝パオラ,ch10_28_Paora_F_Normal,Face|...$k$p$WmMPID_ティータ,ch10_30_Tita_F_Normal,Face|When we fell in love, I prayed he\nwould never remember his past...\nor any lover he left behind.$k$pThe other clerics said such selfish\ndesires would never sway the will\nof the divine.$k$p$WmMPID_ジーク,ch10_31_Zeke_M_Normal,Face|Tatiana, that's—$k$p$WmMPID_ティータ,ch10_30_Tita_F_Normal,Face|I want what's best for Zeke, so...\nI thought we could ask around to\nsee what we might learn.$k$pWill you help me, Palla? And you too,\nLuthier! For Zeke?$k$p$WmMPID_リュート,ch10_29_Lute_M_Normal,Face|I will do what I can, but I know just\nas much about this place as any of\nyou three do.$k$p$WmMPID_ティータ,ch10_30_Tita_F_Normal,Face|Palla, you've been all over Valentia\nand beyond in your travels, right?\nDo you have any idea where to start?$k$p$WmMPID_外伝パオラ,ch10_28_Paora_F_Normal,Face|Hm. I suppose you have a point.\nLet me think, and I'll see what\nI can come up with.$k$p...$k$p...Who would possibly know more\nabout his early life? Hmm...$k$p"
