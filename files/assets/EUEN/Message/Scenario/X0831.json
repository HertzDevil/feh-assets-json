Thank you for the invitation,\nLyn. Was I correct in hearing your\nfriend's name is Mark?$k$p$WmMPID_リン,ch03_38_Mark_NF_Pair,Face|That's right. We were both whisked\naway here by some unknown force.$k$pOh! I should mention that Mark is an\naspiring tactician.$k$p$WmMPID_幼少ヘクトル,ch03_05_Hector_M_Before01,Face|Dang, that's impressive. You've gotta\nbe pretty smart to do a job like that.$k$p$WmMPID_リン,ch03_38_Mark_NF_Pair,Face|Of course!

Bah, they're\ngone.$k$pWhy'd she get so worked up over\nthat?

But I...$k$pI was taught how to ride a horse and\nswing a sword on the plains, but\nthat's far from a formal education.$k$pI learned from the people in my tribe,\nunlike those two, who had teachers,\ntextbooks, and classrooms.$k$pI can't help but feel embarrassed\nwhen everyone else seems to know\nthings that I don't.$k$pEliwood and Hector are the children\nof nobles, right?
