They're heading this way\nnow!$k$p$WmMPID_オリヴィエ2,ch04_03_Olivie_F_Normal2,Face|Oh no... We're about to face another\nbattle, aren't we?$k$p$WmMPID_マリアベル,ch04_28_Mariabell_F_Normal,Face|Judging by the direction they're\nheading... Do you suppose their goal\nis the village near this tower?$k$pI shall not allow them to do as they\nplease within the borders of Ylisse.\nWe must intercept them at once.$k$p$WmMPID_スミア,ch04_27_Smia_F_Normal,Face|But their numbers are far greater\nthan ours.

Well, we're\nfrom another world. It's a long story.$k$p$WmMPID_リベラ,ch04_29_Riviera_F_Normal,Face|If you're here to help, it matters not\nwhere you're from. We thank you for\nyour aid.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face|Just leave it to us. Our numbers may\nbe few, but we pack a punch!
