I can't\nfind you anywhere!$k$pYou should know better than to try\nand hide from me, dearie. How\nnaughty you are!$k$p$WmMPID_クリフ,ch10_17_Qulyf_M_Normal,Face|Are you two...sisters? Cousins\nmaybe?$k$p$WmMPID_インバース,ch04_31_Inverse_F_Normal,Face|There must be something wrong with\nyour eyes, little boy. We don't look a\nthing alike.$k$p$WmMPID_クリフ,ch10_17_Qulyf_M_Normal,Face|It's not your looks, exactly... But\nthere is something about the two\nof you. It's eerie.$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face|Oh, my. Is that so? I think you'll find\nthere's one big difference between\nus.$k$pYou see...$Nu\nlikes just ONE of us.$k$p$WmMPID_インバース,ch04_31_Inverse_F_Normal,Face|And I imagine you think that it's you...\nWhat a show-off.$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face|We're like two peas in a very cozy\npod, $Nu and I...$k$pI'm much more charming than you\nare, dear. And I'm obviously so much\nstronger. We make a perfect pair.$k$p$WmMPID_インバース,ch04_31_Inverse_F_Normal,Face|Stronger? I think we had better see\nabout that.$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face|You want to fight me? How adorable.$k$pI'll just have to kill you, then... Too\nbad, I suppose, but I must do what I\nhave to...for $Nu.$k$p$WmMPID_ウード,ch04_20_Eudes_M_Normal,Face|Ladies! We are allies here, bound by\nfate! You must not quarrel!

So you were summoned too.\nSniveling as usual, I see.$k$p$WmMPID_ウード,ch04_20_Eudes_M_Normal,Face|Sniveling? The chosen one does not\nsnivel!$k$pNow, as we have gathered under one\nflag as allies, it makes no sense to\nfight each other! I have an idea...$k$pIf you would fight, prove your worth\non the battlefield. Surely THAT would\nimpress $Nu!$k$p$WmMPID_ロキ,ch00_08_Loki_F_Normal,Face|You do have something there, dear...\nI can prove just how strong I am.

What is that?$k$p$WmMPID_ウード,ch04_20_Eudes_M_Normal,Face|Only a village-dweller of the utmost\nconsequence, snagged in the skein\nof fate, could be...Villager Ablaze!$k$pYour portentous utterances touched\noff this contest of wills! You must see\nit through to the bitter end!$k$p$WmMPID_クリフ,ch10_17_Qulyf_M_Normal,Face|What...are...you...talking...about?$k$p"
