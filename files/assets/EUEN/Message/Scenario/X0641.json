Specialize how?$k$p$nMPID_エリーゼ|You distract the target with some\nninja mystique, and then I'll swoop\nin and knock them out cold!$k$p$nMPID_比翼カムイ女|Now, hold on! You think I know\nanything about \"mystique\"?! I've\nnever been a ninja before either!$k$p$nMPID_エリーゼ|That's what the training is for! There\nis only one way to learn...
