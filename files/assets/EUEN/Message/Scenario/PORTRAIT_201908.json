They\nattacked us out of nowhere!$k$p$WmMPID_ヒューベルト,ch17_06_Hubert_M_Normal,Face|And on monastery grounds, no less.\nIt's a wonder that the goddess didn't\nsmite them outright. Heh.$k$p$WmMPID_メルセデス,ch17_17_Mercedes_F_Normal,Face|We seem to have been separated\nfrom the others. I hope that they're\nall right.$k$p$WmMPID_ヒルダ,ch17_25_Hilda_F_Normal,Face|Speaking of which, where's Petra?\nShe was right here, and now she's—$k$p$WmMPID_ペトラ,ch17_12_Petra_F_Normal,Face|My returning is complete. Are you\nhaving injuries?$k$p$WmMPID_メルセデス,ch17_17_Mercedes_F_Normal,Face|Oh, thank goodness you're safe,\nPetra!

The chances say that they\nare friends of our enemies!$k$p$WmMPID_ヒューベルト,ch17_06_Hubert_M_Normal,Face|I'm not so sure. If they wanted to\nattack us, they would have done so\nby now. Petra, stand down!$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Pain|Hey, ease up! We're not your enemy.\nWe come peacefully.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|We are from another world, and we\ncould use your help. We don't want\nto fight you.$k$p$WmMPID_メルセデス,ch17_17_Mercedes_F_Normal,Face|Oh my. Another world? I don't think\nI quite understand.$k$p$WmMPID_ヒューベルト,ch17_06_Hubert_M_Normal,Face|You're looking for recruits, and you\nturn to four students? Sounds like a\ntrap to me.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Pain|They all look completely incredulous.\nThis will take a while to explain...$k$p"
