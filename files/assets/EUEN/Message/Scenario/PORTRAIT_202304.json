    "value": "$WmMPID_セテス,ch17_27_Seteth_M_Normal,Face|When I was summoned to Askr, there\nwere only a few students and house\nleaders here.$k$pNow, the number of those affiliated\nwith the Officers Academy and the\nmonastery has grown considerably.$k$p$WmMPID_レア,ch17_37_Rare_F_Normal,Face|I was surprised by that, myself. Many\nstudents greet me as I walk through\nthe halls of the castle...$k$pBefore too long, I may catch myself\nforgetting I'm in Askr and thinking\nI'm back at the monastery!$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Indeed. There are many from Fódlan\namong those who lend their aid to\nthe Order of Heroes.$k$p$WmMPID_シルヴァン,ch17_16_Sylvain_M_Normal,Face|There are even other Sylvains here\nwho come from a different Fódlan\nthan mine, yeah?$k$pHave to admit, it kind of surprised me\nwhen someone asked why I wasn't\nwearing my swimsuit earlier...$k$p$WmMPID_フェリクス,ch17_14_Felix_M_Normal,Face|I was asked something similar. I could\ncare less about the style choices of\nsome other version of me...$k$pBut fielding all these questions is\nhonestly becoming annoying.$k$p$WmMPID_魔器イングリット,ch17_19_Ingrid_F_Weapon01,Face|I saw a version of myself from two\nyears ago summoned, donning the\nuniform of the Officers Academy.$k$p$WmMPID_レア,ch17_37_Rare_F_Normal,Face|So your Fódlan must be two years\nahead of ours in time.$k$p$WmMPID_魔器イングリット,ch17_19_Ingrid_F_Weapon01,Face|Yes. It seems the time in Fódlan I was\nsummoned from is some time after\nwhen you three were summoned.$k$p$WmMPID_セテス,ch17_27_Seteth_M_Normal,Face|Coming back to my original point...$k$pNot only are there students here in\nAskr, but Manuela and Aelfric as well,\nboth in a position to guide them.$k$pI have also seen Catherine of the\nKnights of Seiros and Shamir.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|The Gatekeeper—not to mention the\ndoggies and kitties that came along\nwith him—is doing great too!$k$p$WmMPID_セテス,ch17_27_Seteth_M_Normal,Face|If there are this many from Garreg\nMach Monastery here in Askr...$k$pIt may be possible to establish a\nsecond monastery in this land as well.$k$p$WmMPID_レア,ch17_37_Rare_F_Normal,Face|A second Garreg Mach Monastery?$k$pIf the purpose of such an undertaking\nwas to support the students and not\nto preach the teachings of Seiros...$k$pWhat say you, Prince Alfonse?$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|If we can provide support in any way,\ndon't hesitate to ask. We are glad to\nbe of service.$k$p$WmMPID_レア,ch17_37_Rare_F_Normal,Face|Thank you, Prince Alfonse.$k$p$WmMPID_魔器イングリット,ch17_19_Ingrid_F_Weapon01,Face|If we're to establish a second Garreg\nMach Monastery...$k$pSurely it would make sense for an\nOfficers Academy to stand alongside\nit, wouldn't it?$k$p"
