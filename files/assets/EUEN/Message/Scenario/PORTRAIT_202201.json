I still have\na hard time believing it...$k$p$WmMPID_開花ヨシュア,ch08_07_Jhosua_M_Bloom01,Face|I may be a king, but I'm still Joshua.\nJust because my title suddenly\nchanged doesn't mean that I have.$k$pBesides, last I checked, this isn't\nJehanna, and my title means little.\nNothing between us has changed.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|As you wish, Joshua.$k$pBut if I may be so bold, you may\nclaim that you haven't changed after\nbecoming king...$k$pBut it seems to me that you're\ncarrying yourself more regally than\nthe Joshua I know.$k$p$WmMPID_開花ヨシュア,ch08_07_Jhosua_M_Bloom01,Face|The mercenary one, huh? Well, I've\nmade my decision. It's up to him to\nmake his.$k$pLet's just say that I've done some\nsoul-searching. There's no reason he\ncan't do the same.$k$pThough...not being burdened by a\ncrown does let him spend more time\nswinging his sword...$k$p$WmMPID_レナック,ch08_27_Renac_M_Normal,Face|And here I hoped that being\nsummoned to Askr meant avoiding a\ncertain overeager princess...$k$pBut of course she's already here. She\njust can't resist sticking her nose\nwhere it doesn't belong.$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Princess L'Arachel always said that\nyou would find your way to her, even\nall the way in Askr!$k$p$WmMPID_レナック,ch08_27_Renac_M_Normal,Face|Ugh. So who's going to take the\nblame for getting me into this mess?\nIs it you, $Nu?$k$pDid it never occur to you that I might\nbe avoiding her and the old man on\npurpose?$k$p$WmMPID_ネイミー,ch08_29_Namy_F_Normal,Face|I was...a little overwhelmed at first,\nbut I'm glad that Colm was able to\ncome along with me.$k$p$WmMPID_コーマ,ch08_28_Coma_M_Normal,Face|Hmm...$k$p$WmMPID_ネイミー,ch08_29_Namy_F_Normal,Face|Is something wrong, Colm?$k$p$WmMPID_コーマ,ch08_28_Coma_M_Normal,Face|Huh? Oh, uh... Nah.$k$pCome on, Neimi. How long are you\ngoing to keep pouting?$k$p$WmMPID_ネイミー,ch08_29_Namy_F_Normal,Face|I-I'm not pouting! I'm just a little\nanxious, that's all! *sniff*$k$p$WmMPID_コーマ,ch08_28_Coma_M_Normal,Face|Hey now, no crying. We're all here\nfor a reason. Take comfort in that.$k$pIf the people of Askr need some help,\nI say we do what we can... For a small\nfee, of course.$k$p$WmMPID_開花ヨシュア,ch08_07_Jhosua_M_Bloom01,Face|The people. Right...$k$p"
