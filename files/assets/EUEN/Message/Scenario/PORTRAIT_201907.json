How did we land\nourselves in this predicament?$k$p$WmMPID_ベレス,ch17_01_Beleth_F_Normal,Face|I'm just glad you three aren't hurt.\nThose soldiers seem dangerous,\nwhoever they are.$k$p$WmMPID_ディミトリ,ch17_03_Dimitri_M_Normal,Face|Agreed. They do not look like bandits,\nbut they're not from any army that\nI could recognize.$k$p$WmMPID_エーデルガルト,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_Normal,Face|It's not only the enemies—even the\nlandscape is alien. We don't seem to\nbe in the forests of Garreg Mach.$k$p$WmMPID_ベレス,ch17_01_Beleth_F_Normal,Face|An unfamiliar enemy in an unfamiliar\nforest. Just what is happening here,\nI wonder?$k$p$WmMPID_エーデルガルト,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_Normal,Face|Perhaps there are locals nearby who\ncan apprise us of our situation. First,\nhowever...$k$p$WmMPID_ディミトリ,ch17_03_Dimitri_M_Normal,Face|Yes. I had the same thought. Claude,\nwhere exactly are you going?$k$p$WmMPID_クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_Normal,Face|Oh, you noticed! Your Highnesses\nwere so busy conferring, I thought I'd\nhave time to make a strategic retreat.$k$p$WmMPID_ディミトリ,ch17_03_Dimitri_M_Normal,Face|A \"strategic retreat,\" hm? That has a\nfamiliar ring to it.$k$p$WmMPID_エーデルガルト,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_Normal,Face|Why am I not surprised? Claude, that\nis not an option here. We do not even\nknow where we are.$k$p$WmMPID_クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_Normal,Face|Fine, fine. But we're not going to find\nhelp by standing around here, waiting\nfor someone to—$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face|Hello, strangers! Did I overhear you\nsay you needed help?$k$p$WmMPID_エーデルガルト,ch17_02_Edelgardr_F_Normal,Face|...You were saying, Claude?$k$p$WmMPID_ディミトリ,ch17_03_Dimitri_M_Normal,Face|We were talking rather loudly,\nI suppose.$k$p$WmMPID_クロード,ch17_04_Claude_M_Normal,Face|Well, how do you like that! The gods\nof fortune are smiling on us today.\nWouldn't you agree, Teach?$k$p"
