Such a collection of unusual\ncontraptions! This must be what you\ncall seiðjárn.$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|You have my thanks for helping us,\nEitri, but I worry for you, having just\nopposed the king in such a way...$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Don't fret. His mood may be no\nbetter now, but I can't imagine it\ngetting much worse.$k$pWithout seiðjárn, Niðavellir would be\nnothing compared to what it is now.\nFáfnir can't afford to punish me.$k$p$WmMPID_アンナ,ch00_03_Anna_F_Normal,Face_Anger|Hm! Such insight for someone of\nyour years. I suppose that is what\nmakes you a genius.$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face|Eitri, I am King Fáfnir's younger sister,\nReginn. I'm glad to finally meet you.$k$p$EFace_Anger|You must already have some idea,\nbut something is wrong with Fáfnir.\nHe now thinks only of conquest.$k$p$EFace_Pain2|He wasn't always that way. He used\nto say he wanted to make Niðavellir\na land of plenty...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Fáfnir now poses a great threat to the\nKingdom of Askr. I hope to stop him.\nWill you help us?$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face|First, let me ask you this... Do you\nknow how Niðavellir came to be?$k$p$WmMPID_シャロン,ch00_02_Sharon_F_Normal,Face_Cool2|Hmm... I think I remember studying\nits history, but I can't recall...$k$p$WmMPID_アルフォンス,ch00_01_Alfons_M_Normal,Face|Long ago, the dvergar were ruled by\nthe jötnar—but a young dvergr used\ntheir craft to build great weapons.$k$pWith those weapons, the dvergar\nfought on equal footing with the\njötnar and gained independence.$k$pThat young dvergr was named king,\nand thus Niðavellir was born.$k$p$WmMEID_エイトリ,ch00_35_Eitri_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Quite right. After that, the first king\nfostered a culture of inventors, and\nthat is how seiðjárn came into being.$k$p$EFace|As something of an inventor myself,\nI have the utmost respect for our\nfirst king—and I love this country.$k$pBut a coup d'état brought Niðavellir\nto ruin... I will do anything to save this\ncountry, so you have my support.$k$p$WmMPID_レギン,ch00_30_Reghin_F_Normal,Face_Smile|Thank you, Eitri! I had hoped you'd\nsay just that!$k$p$Sbs150|"
